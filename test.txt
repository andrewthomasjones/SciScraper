AbstractWe have designed a microfluidic device in which we can manipulate, lyse, label, separate, and quantify the protein contents of a single cell using single-molecule fluorescence counting. Generic labeling of proteins is achieved through fluorescent-antibody binding. The use of cylindrical optics enables high-efficiency (60%) counting of molecules in micrometer-sized channels. We used this microfluidic device to quantify 2 adrenergic receptors expressed in insect cells (SF9). We also analyzed phycobiliprotein contents in individual cyanobacterial cells (Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942) and observed marked differences in the levels of specific complexes in cell populations that were grown under nitrogen-depleted conditions.Single-cell analysis has become a highly attractive tool for investigating cellular contents (1). Unlike conventional methods that are performed with large cell populations, this technology avoids the loss of information associated with ensemble averaging. Recent studies have described methods that can quantify specific proteins inside a single cell (2-4) by means of integrated fluorescence (including confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and monitoring fluorescent enzymatic products) and, in another instance (5), by single-molecule imaging. These techniques restrict analysis to one or perhaps a few species at a time because of the need to resolve fluorescence from different probes. Moreover, their applications are limited in the cases where the cell environment changes the fluorescence of the reporter molecule (e.g., through quenching or resonance energy transfer) or where endogenous fluorescence interferes with the measurements.We present a different approach based on manipulating, capturing, and lysing a single cell, followed by chemical separation and analysis of the lysate. This approach sacrifices the possibility of monitoring live cells but gains the ability to quantify multiple targets that cannot be distinguished by fluorescence properties alone. Recent achievements-including the analysis of DNA (6), amino acid profiles (7), and protein fingerprints (8)-use either a capillary or a microfluidic platform. Compared with the former platform, microfluidics allows sophisticated cell manipulation and provides the potential for extremely high detection sensitivity as well as high-throughput screening.Low-copy-number proteins (present at fewer than 1000 molecules per cell) play an important role in cell functioning, including signaling and the regulation of gene expression. Without amplification procedures, their abundance is far below the sensitivity limits of conventional protein analysis methods, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and mass spectroscopy. To solve this problem, we used single-molecule fluorescence detection, which has been applied to counting DNA or protein molecules in sheathed flows, capillaries, and microfluidic channels (9-11).Our single-cell analysis chip for mammalian and insect cells (Fig. 1A) is made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and has three sections: cell manipulation, electrophoretic separation, and single-molecule counting. For cell manipulation, we used a three-state valve design that has been demonstrated previously (7). After the cell was captured in the reaction chamber formed between the three-state valve and a conventional two-state valve, a lysing/labeling buffer was injected into the chamber so that the cell contents were released (Fig. 1B). In our experiment with proteins that are not naturally fluorescent, we used fluorescently labeled antibodies as a generic method to tag target proteins. A nonionic detergent, 1 weight percent (wt%) n-dodecyl--D-maltoside (DDM), was used as the lysing reagent, which preserved the activity of the antibodies.

(C) Schematic illustration of the excitation laser focused by the microscope objective and the dimensions of the molecule-counting channel. (D) One frame from the CCD images of fluorescent molecules flowing across the molecule-counting section (upper panel) and the identification results (lower panel). After the labeling reaction occurred, the excess labeling reagent was electrophoretically separated from the target proteins. To reduce the transportation loss of the sample, the separation buffer contained 0.1 wt% DDM so that protein adsorption on the hydrophobic PDMS channel walls was essentially suppressed (12). A low concentration (1/20.005 to 1/20.05 wt%) of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) was added to generate sufficient electro-osmotic flow by its adsorption to the PDMS surface (13). Although we used DDM/SDS separation for all of our experiments, we could have used any other electrophoretic/chromatographic separation method that is compatible with a PDMS microfluidic chip.At the end of the separation channel, fluorescent molecules were counted by monitoring the number of fluorescence bursts generated when the molecules flowed through a small detection volume. For single-molecule counting, the most common approach to obtaining a high signal-to-noise ratio is to use confocal fluorescence microscopy, but its detection cross section (approximately 500 nm wide by 1 1/2m high) is much smaller than the cross section of an ordinary microfluidic channel (100 1/2m by 10 1/2m), which results in extremely poor detection efficiency (14). Several groups have attempted to solve this problem by decreasing the dimensions of the channel or capillary to the nanometer range so that the entire cross section fits into the focus of the confocal microscope (15-17). Such a small channel dimension, however, could affect the electrophoretic separation of molecules in cell lysates (18, 19) and could also lead to a clogging of the nanochannel with cell debris.To resolve the counting-efficiency problem, we widened the excitation laser focus in one direction by using cylindrical optics. The excitation laser beam was focused by a cylindrical lens to form a line at the back focal plane of a high-numerical-aperture objective (fig. S1). When the laser beam emerged from the objective, it was collimated in the direction perpendicular to the channel length so that it illuminated a channel width of tens of micrometers (Fig. 1C). In the other direction, the laser was still tightly focused by the objective to minimize the fluorescence background from out-of-focus excitation. The limit of the channel height by the excitation focus was 1/22 1/2m (fig. S1B), which was slightly relaxed as compared to confocal detection because the laser was less tightly focused. This height was large enough to avoid clogging in our experiments.With this optical configuration, the excitation laser formed a rectangular, curtain-shaped detection region across the channel. The fluorescence from molecules that passed through the curtain was recorded by an intensified charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. We used a threshold criterion to identify each molecule as a bright spot in an image frame (Fig. 1D). To enhance the fluorescence signal for molecule counting, we slowed down the flow rate when an analyte was expected to pass through the detection curtain.Because of the variation in excitation laser intensity at different positions in the channel cross section, molecules that passed through the periphery of the channel produced lower fluorescence signals, which could be lost in the background noise. As a result, the detection efficiency varied slightly according to the brightness of a specific sample molecule. We have measured the molecular-counting efficiency of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled streptavidin in a standard double-T chip and found that 60% of the injected molecules are counted (20). A general method was then developed to estimate detection efficiencies directly from counting experiments by varying the threshold of molecule identification (20). In this way, the actual number of molecules can be derived without additional calibration.Using the single-cell analysis chip, we quantified the copy number of a human transmembrane protein, 2 adrenergic receptor (2AR), expressed in an insect cell line (SF9). 2AR is not naturally fluorescent. Therefore, we genetically added a short peptide sequence, the FLAG tag, to the N terminus (21), so that it could bind Cy5-labeled monoclonal M1 antibody against FLAG (Cy5-M1) with high affinity (dissociation constant = 2.4 nM) (22). The antibody concentration was 20 nM in the lysis/labeling buffer, which caused 1/290% of the 2AR to be fluorescently tagged. 2AR in SF9 cells can be efficiently extracted with 1 wt% DDM, which is demonstrated by the rapid disappearance of fluorescence from Cy5-M1-stained cells when the lysing buffer is added.The immunocomplexes of Cy5-M1 and purified 2AR could be separated with the DDM/SDS system (Fig. 2A). Figure 2B lists the molecule-counting results of five transfected SF9 cells. These cells contained an average of 1/21.8 * 104 2AR per cell, which was in agreement with the ensemble measurement using cell lysate [4 * 104 2AR per cell, detectable by Cy5-M1 binding (20)]. The copy numbers of 2AR in these cells varied between 1/22000 and 1/260,000. By staining with Cy5-M1 (Fig. 2A, inset), we could observe similar variations in whole-cell fluorescence intensity, although cell staining detects only the 2AR that is present on the cell surface. This cell-to-cell variation is probably caused by the stochastic nature of virus infection; i.e., individual cells are not infected simultaneously and may contain different numbers of viral particles, resulting in different expression levels of 2AR.

(B) Molecule-counting results of SF9 cells expressing 2AR, showing the electropherogram of the M1-AR complexes. The red line represents the average count rate. The total counts are corrected for the counting efficiency, the existence of M1-(AR)2 complexes, and blank counts in the control experiment (5613 molecules). The control experiment was performed by separating lysis/labeling buffer in the reaction chamber with no cells captured. The background counts were mainly caused by the tailing of the large free-antibody peak that came earlier in the electropherogram (not shown). To demonstrate a biological application of single-cell analysis, we studied the response of the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 (Synechococcus hereafter) to the depletion of nitrogen-containing nutrients in the culture medium (chlorosis). Cyanobacteria and some eukaryotic algae use the phycobilisome (PBS), a peripheral membrane protein-chromophore complex, to collect the light energy and transfer it to the photosynthetic reaction centers (23). In Synechococcus cells, the PBS comprises mainly two pigmented phycobiliproteins (PBPs): phycocyanin (PC), which exists in the peripheral rods, and allophycocyanin (APC), which forms the core structure. It also contains various linker polypeptides that function to hold together the assembly and to tune the complex for efficient energy flow into the photosynthetic reaction centers. A chromophore-containing linker polypeptide designated LCM attaches the PBS to photosystem II on the thylakoid membrane (23, 24).When grown under conditions in which certain macronutrients (such as nitrogen) are depleted, these cyanobacteria begin to degrade their PBS in an ordered way (first PC, then APC). This process reduces the absorption of excess light energy and provides cells with nutrients from the degraded PBP, helping them to attain a quiescent state almost devoid of the PBS (Fig. 3A, inset) (23, 25). To characterize this process at the ensemble level, we lysed Synechococcus that was cultured in nitrogen-replete (+N) or nitrogen-depleted (-N) media using the combination of lysozyme and a nonionic surfactant. The extracted PBP complexes in the lysate were electrophoretically separated on a microfluidic chip. As shown in Fig. 3A, after Synechococcus wasculturedina -N medium for more than 72 hours, all peaks related to PC (peaks 1 and 4 to 9) nearly disappeared. The two major PBP peaks that remained correspond to two APC subassemblies in the PBS core (peak 2 is the APC-LCM complexand peak 3 is an APC trimer). These observations are consistent with a previously described model for chlorosis (23). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

Red lines show the result of least-square linear fitting. The inset shows cell a, which is excluded from the fitting because its value would dominate the fit. Although isolated PC and APC molecules are highly fluorescent, they are difficult to quantify in cells by fluorescence intensities because of the highly efficient energy transfer in the light-harvesting protein complexes, their large spectral overlap, and the fluorescence background from chlorophylls in the photosystems. Our single-cell analysis approach is particularly advantageous because it incorporates chemical separation before fluorescence detection.We used a chip with three simplified reaction chambers (Fig. 3B) so that up to three cells could be simultaneously lysed. Laser-induced fluorescence detection was used to analyze the +N cells (Fig. 3C) because of their high PBP concentration, whereas molecule counting was used to analyze the -N cells (Fig. 3D). Among the three -N cells shown in Fig. 3D, cell b contains 548 copies of PBP complexes in peak 2 and 839 copies in peak 3, and the detection limit (two times the standard deviation of background counts from noise) is seven molecules. Figure 3E shows the distribution of the molecule numbers of the two PBS core subassemblies (peaks 2 and 3) from 10 -N cells. The cell-to-cell variation in overall PBP counts of -N cells is much larger than that of +N cells. The number of molecules present in these two subassemblies shows a high correlation (r2 = 0.93) over the entire distribution range. This relation indicates that a constant ratio of these two complexes was maintained during the degradation of the PBS under -N conditions and that, as bleaching of the cells proceeded, the complexes were simultaneously lost. These results suggest coordinated degradation of PBS components within the core of the PBS.Among the 10 -N cells examined, cell a in Fig. 3D had much brighter fluorescence and much higher molecule counts than the others. Its electropherogram resembled those from +N cells, which indicated an incomplete proteolysis of the PBS. This cell represents those -N cells that have atypically bright fluorescence (1/25% of all cells) when observed by fluorescence microscopy. In ensemble experiments in which cell populations are examined, these cells would not be detected because of their low frequencies of appearance. The occurrence of this rare cell could be a consequence of genetic variation within the population, although more work (possibly using Synechococcus mutants defective in PBS degradation or using carefully monitored isogenic lines) needs to be done to test this hypothesis.The method described here should have many applications, making the chemical analysis of single cells by single-molecule counting a new tool for understanding the functioning of cells. Other applications, such as the use of fluorescent proteins that can be genetically fused or the use of dye molecules (such as the biarsenical dye, FlAsH, and its variants) that bind to specific peptide sequences, may further expand the scope of this method to include the monitoring of gene expression and suppression.

AbstractThe late Paleozoic deglaciation is the vegetated Earth's only recorded icehouse-to-greenhouse transition, yet the climate dynamics remain enigmatic. By using the stable isotopic compositions of soil-formed minerals, fossil-plant matter, and shallow-water brachiopods, we estimated atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and tropical marine surface temperatures during this climate transition. Comparison to southern Gondwanan glacial records documents covariance between inferred shifts in pCO2, temperature, and ice volume consistent with greenhouse gas forcing of climate. Major restructuring of paleotropical flora in western Euramerica occurred in step with climate and pCO2 shifts, illustrating the biotic impact associated with past CO2-forced turnover to a permanent ice-free world.A decade of studying Pleistocene ice cores has unequivocally documented a strong coupling of atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and surface temperatures with changing global ice volume (1, 2). Although the precise mechanistic link between atmospheric greenhouse gases and climate is debated, there remains little doubt that high concentrations of atmospheric CO2 have strongly amplified Earth's past climates. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions have increased atmospheric CO2 to concentrations higher than at any time in at least the past 650,000 years and could increase it to more than 2000 parts per million by volume (ppmv) as accessible fossil fuel reservoirs are exhausted (3). The last time such concentrations were seen on Earth was at the onset of our modern icehouse [1/240 to 34 million years ago (Ma)], a transition from ice-free to glacial conditions characterized by repeated C cycle perturbation, large magnitude changes in atmospheric pCO2, and major ephemeral warmings (4, 5). As our climate system departs from the well-studied Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, a deep-time perspective of pCO2-climate-glaciation linkages is essential for a fuller understanding of what may be the Earth's most epic deglaciation.We present here the results of a multipronged investigation that provides evidence for significantly changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and surface temperatures during a 40-million-year period of the late Paleozoic (1/2305 to 265 Ma), which encompasses the deterioration of the most widespread and long-lived icehouse of the last half-billion years (6). This global warming event accompanied a permanent transition to an ice-free world, a condition that arguably lasted until the current glacial state. These results, when integrated with a newly emerging glaciation history for southern Gondwana (7-11), indicate strong linkages between pCO2, climate, and ice-mass dynamics during the final stages of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (end of LPIA). Integration of these climate proxy records with our newly developed tropical paleobotanical records shows repeated climate-driven ecosystem restructuring in western paleo-equatorial Euramerica.The CO2 contents of ancient atmospheres can be estimated from the carbon stable isotope values (13C) of ancient soil-formed carbonates and goethites with an uncertainty of 500 ppmv (12, 13). These minerals are the proxy of choice when pCO2 is high (1000 ppmv), whereas the method's sensitivity decreases at lower pCO2 (13C of coexisting organic matter is available and if quantitative estimates of paleosoil-respired CO2 content and paleotemperatures can be inferred from modern analogs or independently derived geochemical proxies (15).To reconstruct atmospheric CO2 during the end of the LPIA, we measured the 13C values of soil-formed calcites (13Ccarb) collected from mature, well-drained profiles from the Eastern Shelf of the Midland Basin; the Pedregosa, Anadarko, and Paradox Basins; and the Grand Canyon Embayment of western paleoequatorial Euramerica (fig. S1 and table S1) (17). We consider measured paleosol 13Ccarb values to be a robust proxy of soil-water CO2 during formation, given the lack of evidence for mineral recrystallization and overgrowth and their overall shallow and low-temperature burial histories (18). Furthermore, we consider the 13C of well-preserved fossil plant matter (13Corg) tobea faithful proxy of the C isotope composition of soil-respired CO2 and, in turn, of atmospheric CO2 (19, 20). Compression and permineralized fossil plants, cuticles, coal, and charcoal were collected from mudstone deposits of abandoned fluvial channels and floodplains, which are stratigraphically intercalated (on a sub-10-m resolution) with carbonate-bearing paleosols (table S2). The use of measured 13Corg rather than penecontemporaneous marine carbonates as a proxy of atmospheric 13C reflects a growing appreciation of local-scale C cycling effects on the 13C values of epicontinental marine carbonates (21). The terrestrial 13Ccarb and 13Corg time series have an average sampling interval of 13Corg trend records first-order variations in atmospheric 13C is supported by its similarity to time-equivalent 13Corg records of Permo-Carboniferous coals from the North China Platform (22) and by a narrow range, throughout the study area, in the ratio of intracellular, pi, and atmospheric, pa, partial pressures of CO2 in paleoflora [0.46 to 0.57 0.3 (2 SE)], which were estimated by using measured 13Corg values of fossil plants and 13Ccarb values of contemporaneous marine brachiopods (17). These factors indicate that changes in geomorphic or environmental conditions in the study area were secondary to atmospheric 13C in influencing measured fossil-plant 13Corg values.

Vertical bars are published goethite-based CO2 estimates from the same set of paleosols (25). Ranges of paleosoil-respired CO2 content were inferred from the morphologies of suites of contemporaneous paleosols (23) by comparison with modern analogs, addressing a major source of uncertainty in previous applications of the CO2 paleobarometer (table S3) (14, 15). Paleosol temperatures were inferred from the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of pedogenic phyllosilicates and Fe oxides obtained from the same set of paleosols (18, 24). The best estimate of paleoatmospheric pCO2 was defined by using Monte Carlo simulation involving 1000 randomly drawn samples for each variable for each time-location combination (17). Monte Carlo simulation uses random sampling techniques to stochastically solve physical process problems, in this case quantitatively estimating paleo-pCO2 and the associated uncertainty by integrating across all of the inferred and measured input variables.Modeled CO2 concentrations (Fig. 1C and table S4) define a long-term rise from an average of present atmospheric levels (PAL = 280 ppmv) in the earliest Permian to values of up to 3500 ppmv by the late Early Permian. A substantial decline in pCO2 into the early Middle Permian is corroborated by independently derived goethite-based estimates of Permian pCO2 (25). A short-lived (1/22 My) drop in pCO2 to near PAL, defined by contemporaneous paleosols, punctuates the Early Permian rise. Modeled pCO2 suggests that PAL values were limited to the earliest Permian after latest Carboniferous levels of up to 1000 ppmv, in accord with pCO2 inferred from marine carbonate 13C (26) and with southern Gondwanan sedimentologic and geochemical evidence for latest Carboniferous warming (9, 27). Our record refines the structure of well-established pCO2 reconstructions, which indicate sustained PAL values throughout much of the Permo-Carboniferous (15, 28, 29). The higher-frequency oscillations revealed by this study would be below the temporal resolution (5 to 20 My time-averaging) of those long-term CO2 records.In order to evaluate the nature of the CO2-climate relationship, we developed a time-equivalent record of paleotropical sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) by using 18O values from a global compilation of well-preserved latest Carboniferous through Middle Permian tropical shallow-water brachiopods (table S5) (30); brachiopods have diagenetically resistant, low-Mg calcitic shells that incorporate oxygen isotopes in equilibrium with seawater (31). The residual brachiopod 18O record (Fig. 2A) displays clear isotopic fluctuations, with intervals of maximum values corresponding to Permian glacial maxima or marked coolings in Antarctica and/or Australia (10, 11) and, to the degree afforded by geochronologic dates, with the younger periods of inferred glacial maxima in the Karoo Basin (8, 32), southern Argentina (9), and Tasmania (33). Intervals of minimum 18Ocarb values correspond with independently inferred periods of marked warming and sea-level rise (7-9, 34)(Fig. 2C).

Blue curves are best estimate (heavy) and uncertainty (light) of paleo-pCO2.(C) Relative sea-level curve compiled from (8, 53); distribution of warm intervals, from (7-9) and (34). Inferring secular paleotemperatures from 18Ocarb requires careful consideration of the compound effects on values of continental ice volume, local hydrography, and SST, as well as any vital effects and postdepositional alteration (31, 35). The eustatic component in the Permo-Carboniferous brachiopod 18O record due to ice volume variability likely accounts for far less than 2 per mil () of the observed 18O variation given reconstructed amplitudes (10 to 18Osw)-sea level relationship of 0.1 per 10 m of sea level change (36). The residual secular 18Ocarb signal is interpreted to record changes in temperature, salinity, and pH. Local hydrographic variations in tropical epicontinental seas would have dampened the magnitude of 18Ocarb shifts, given hypothe-sized heightened freshwater discharge to continental shelves (decreased salinity and lowered 18Osw) during late Paleozoic periods of maximum glaciation, and increased evaporation (increased salinity and 18Osw) during drier, highly seasonal glacial minima (36). Moreover, paleo-SSTs under elevated pCO2 may be under-estimated by up to 2C, given that lowered seawater pH would have shifted 18Ocarb to less negative values (38, 39).The amplitudes of the reconstructed SSTshifts (40) indicate substantial changes in the mean state of tropical climate during the end of the LPIA, with glacial tropical oceans at least 4 to 7C cooler than those of intervening glacial minima (Fig. 2B). Inferred periods of elevated tropical SSTs and pCO2 coincide with independently recognized intervals of warmer temperate conditions in high-latitude southern Gondwana (Fig. 2C) indicated by the accumulation of nonglacial sediments, including extensive kaolin and bauxite deposits in Australia during peak (Artinskian) warming and pCO2 (7) and increased faunal diversity in Australia and South America (7, 11, 41). The covariance among inferred shifts in paleotropical SSTs, pCO2, and variations in high-latitude Gondwanan glaciation and climate implies a strong CO2-climate-glaciation linkage during the Permian. Although our coupled records suggest atmospheric CO2 may have played a direct role in forcing Early to Middle Permian climate and ice mass stability, a determination of phase relationships between these parameters is precluded by the uncertainties in the age models. The inferred variations in tropical SSTs between periods of glacial maxima and minima, however, are consistent with the range predicted by Permian climate simulations for a change in radiative CO2 forcing from 1 to 8 PAL (42).Permo-Carboniferous plant assemblages from western paleoequatorial Euramerica archive a mechanistic vegetational response to late Paleozoic pCO2 and climate change. Reconstructed plant communities from the same terrestrial successions that host the pedogenic mineral-bearing paleosols document major dominance-diversity changes corresponding one-for-one to inferred changes in paleotropical climate, pCO2, and glacial extent (Fig. 3 and table S6). Four tropical biomes appear in succession, composed of increasingly xeromorphic species, representing progressively more seasonally moisture-stressed environments. These biomes are floristically distinct, sharing only a few opportunistic ferns and sphenopsids (43). Typical latest Carboniferous flora, rich in marattialean ferns, medullosan pteridosperms, sphenopsids, and sigillarian lycopsids, was replaced essentially instantaneously by one rich in conifers {Walchia and Ernestiodendron; compare with Brachyphyllum (44), callipterids (Rhachiphyllum), cycadophytes (Russellites), and other seed plants [Cordaites, Sphenopteridium (45)]}. This floristic shift is synchronous with an abrupt continental climate transition from everwet to semi-arid conditions (Fig. 3A), characterized by increased temperatures (18, 24) and seasonal moisture availability inferred from paleosol morphologies (23).

(B) Conifers and peltasperms are xeromorphic and typically are found in association with sedimentologic and pedogenic indicators of moisture limitation. Conifers and callipterids diversified in seasonally dry habitats during the initial Early Permian (Sakmarian) rise in CO2 and the warm period of glacial minima, spatially replacing the tree fern-rich and the pteridosperm-rich wetland floras (Fig. 3). Tree fern-rich floras reappeared during wetter, cooler conditions of the mid-Early Permian (Artinskian) glaciation, stratigraphically intercalated but not mixed, with conifer-callipterid floras. These two glacial floras show limited species overlap and oscillated at the 103- to 105-year scale, reflecting short-lived pluvials (46). Dramatic floristic changes also occurred during the cold period at the close of the Early Permian (Kungurian), with the migration into lowland basins of unique seed-plant assemblages not observed again until the Late Permian (conifers) and the Mesozoic (cycads) (47). These temporally successive floras tracked climatic conditions and contained progressively more evolutionarily advanced lineages. This suggests that evolutionary innovation, the appearance of new plant body plans, occurred in extrabasinal areas and was revealed by climate-driven floral migration into lowland basins.The history of latest Carboniferous to Middle Permian climate provides a unique deep-time perspective on the precarious balance between icehouse and greenhouse states during major climate transitions, which are coupled to changing atmospheric CO2 content. Maximum expansion of Gondwanan continental ice sheets occurred during earliest Permian time (10) under the lowest paleoatmospheric CO2 levels and paleotropical SSTs. Widespread Early Permian (mid-Sakmarian) collapse of ice sheets (8, 10) coincided with the onset of rising atmospheric CO2 levels, after which time tropical SSTs and pCO2 rose. Subsequent glacial influence was restricted to eastern Australia (6), with resurgent ice masses occurring during three more episodes (11) of lowered atmospheric pCO2 before the permanent transition to an ice-free world (260 Ma). Our study indicates that ice buildup in Australia during subsequent cold periods, however, was progressively less widespread, with the two youngest glacials generally confined to local valleys or mountain ice caps along the polar margin of Australian Gondwana. Notably, SSTs and pCO2 did not return to earliest Permian levels during these post-Sakmarian glacial periods.Our reconstructed pCO2, paleotemperatures, and inferred glacial history depict an Early Permian atmosphere that systematically increased from PAL to levels similar to those predicted to exist if fossil fuels are exhausted. Although global-scale deglaciation was unrelenting under rising Early Permian atmospheric CO2, transient periods of icehouse stability and glacial resurgence returned during short-lived intervals of low pCO2, perhaps until a CO2 threshold and greenhouse stability precluded the reestablishment of glacial conditions [compare with (48)]. This late Paleozoic climate behavior mimics, in reverse, the magnitude and temporal scale of atmospheric CO2 changes and ephemeral warmings that foreshadowed the transition into our present glacial state (4, 5), further documenting the degree of climate variability, carbon cycle perturbation, and tropical ecosystem restructuring that has been associated with past CO2-forced climate transitions.
AbstractBecause animals require oxygen, an increase in late-Neoproterozoic oxygen concentrations has been suggested as a stimulus for their evolution. The iron content of deep-sea sediments shows that the deep ocean was anoxic and ferruginous before and during the Gaskiers glaciation 580 million years ago and that it became oxic afterward. The first known members of the Ediacara biota arose shortly after the Gaskiers glaciation, suggesting a causal link between their evolution and this oxygenation event. A prolonged stable oxic environment may have permitted the emergence of bilateral motile animals some 25 million years later.Large, architecturally complex life forms first appeared about 575 million years ago (Ma) (1, 2). These lifeforms are epitomized by the Ediacara biota, a globally distributed assemblage of fossil impressions of centimeter- to meter-scale soft-bodied organisms and colonies. The Ediacara biota developed after the Gaskiers glaciation at 580 Ma and abruptly disappeared coincident with the Cambrian explosion of skeletal animals about 35 million years later (3, 4). The Ediacara biota most likely included a mixture of stem-group animals and potentially other extant kingdoms of eukaryotes, along with fossils that may represent "failed experiments" in evolution (3). Fossilized animal embryos (5) dated at 560 to 580 Ma (6) further support the view that animals were an important part of Ediacaran life. Animals have an absolute requirement for oxygen, and it has been widely hypothesized that a late-Neoproterozoic rise in oxygen created an environment permissive for animal evolution (7-10). Direct evidence for late-Neoproterozoic ocean oxygenation, however, has been lacking. We used several geochemical tracers to show that the deep ocean became oxidized shortly before the first appearance of the Ediacara biota.In the Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland, 6 km of late-Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks represent at least 15 million years of late-Neoproterozoic time (Fig. 1). The sediment sequence begins about 800 m below the glacial deposits and cap carbonate of the Gaskiers Formation dated at 580 Ma (2). The Gaskiers glaciation was the last of the major Neoproterozoic glaciations (4, 11) and is represented on four continents (12), although it was probably not as widespread as the previous Sturtian and Marinoan "snowball" glaciations (11, 12). Ediacara-type fossils are present through most of the post-Gaskiers succession. The first Ediacaran fossils, represented by a low-diversity assemblage of Ivesheadia ("pizza disks"), Thectardis, and species of Charnia (1, 3, 4, 13) (Fig. 2, A and B), were found in the upper Drook Formation within 5 million years of the glacial terminus. These are the earliest large and architecturally complex eukaryote fossils known anywhere in the world. By 565 Ma, the high-density and high-diversity Ediacaran assemblages of Mistaken Point existed (Fig. 2C) (3, 13, 14), and numerous occurrences of Ediacaran disks continue through the Ferme use Formation (Fig. 2D).

The Ediacaran animals of the Avalon Peninsula lived on the sea floor in deep-water environments well below the photic zone (3, 13, 15). The Mall Bay through Briscal Formations (Fig. 1) accumulated as axial basin floor deposits in water depths exceeding several hundred meters, and possibly extending 1 km or more (3, 16). The Mistaken Point and Trepassey Formations represent a deep-water slope environment (14, 15). Beginning with the Fermeuse Formation, the sequence gives way to mudstones likely deposited as delta front deposits (3, 17). The Neoproterozoic sediments of Newfoundland were deposited at the northern margins of ancient Gondwana, with no evidence for basin restriction, suggesting open access to the global ocean (18, 19).We used iron extraction techniques to explore ocean redox conditions. In this approach, operationally defined iron extraction protocols (20) are used to partition iron into its highly reactive components and its unreactive phases. Highly reactive iron includes iron oxide, carbonate, and sulfide minerals; this represents the iron that is geochemically and biologically active during early sediment diagenesis (21). By contrast, "unreactive" iron is geochemically inert on early diagenetic time scales. Previous studies have shown that in a broad suite of marine sediments deposited from an oxygen-containing water column, the ratio of highly reactive iron to total iron (FeHR/FeT) is consistently below 0.38, with a modern average (SD) of 0.26 0.08 (22, 23) and a Phanerozoic average (past 542 million years and excluding the modern) of 0.15 0.06 (23). By contrast, sediments deposited from anoxic water columns may obtain additional reactive iron from iron mineral formation in the water column; in these environments, FeHR/FeT may exceed 0.38.This is true both if the anoxic water column is sulfidic, such as the modern Black Sea (22) and ancient sulfidic marine water bodies (23, 24), and if it contained dissolved iron, as was the case early in Earth'shistory (25). We also used the concentrations of organic carbon and pyrite sulfur, as well as the isotopic composition of sulfur, to aid our characterization of the depositional environment (26) (table S1).There is a marked difference in the proportion of highly reactive iron in sediments deposited before and after the Gaskiers glaciation (Fig. 3A). In numerous instances, the Gaskiers diamictite shows FeHR/FeT ratios exceeding 0.38, indicative of anoxic deposition. This is also the case, to a lesser extent, in the upper Mall Bay Formation. In other cases, the FeHR/FeT ratio of Gaskiers and Mall Bay samples is less than 0.38 but more than both the modern and Phanerozoic average ratios (Fig. 3A). In these cases, the extraction results are somewhat equivocal, but given the numerous instances in which FeHR/FeT exceeds 0.38 and the high overall ratios of FeHR/FeT, the results suggest that the water column was anoxic during deposition of the Gaskiers diamictite and probably also the upper Mall Bay (27). There is little sulfide sulfur in these rocks, and most of the reactive iron is bound as iron oxide and iron carbonate (26). Therefore, a sulfidic water column can be ruled out (25), indicating that the water column was most likely ferruginous, containing elevated concentrations of dissolved ferrous iron (Fe2+). Therefore, the deep-ocean chemistry accompanying the Gaskiers glaciation (and possibly also the Mall Bay) appears similar to the water chemistry associated with the earlier "snowball Earth" glaciations, in which banded iron formations accompanied the deposition of Sturtian-aged diamictites (about 700 Ma) (11) and Fe-enriched carbonates were deposited immediately after the Marinoan glaciation (about 630 Ma) (28), both of which are indicative of ferruginous oceanic conditions.

Also indicated are key dates (as in Fig. 1) and the stratigraphic level of prominent fossil locations. In sediment accumulated immediately after the Gaskiers glaciation and during a period of time representing more than 15 million years, most FeHR/FeT ratios are much lower than in the underlying rocks and fall between the Phanerozoic and modern average for oxic sediment deposition; nearly all are less than 0.38 (Fig. 3A). These data provide evidence for a long period of stable deep-water oxic marine conditions. Overall, our data point to a pre-Drook anoxic iron-containing ocean giving way to oxic marine conditions after the Gaskiers glaciation.For the Mall Bay through the Trepassey Formations, organic carbon concentrations are, in general, extremely low and are completely consistent with deposition in oligotrophic deep-water basinal or outer slope marine settings (29). Whereas higher organic carbon concentrations might be expected under anoxic conditions (30), our rather low concentrations in the Mall Bay and Gaskiers Formations are similar to those found (0.1 to 0.3 weight % C) in the Sturtian-aged (about 730 Ma) Rapitan Iron Formation, which also deposited from anoxic Fe-containing waters (31). The somewhat higher concentrations observed in the Fermeuse Formation are consistent with an environment closer to shore of higher sediment deposition rate such as a delta front would offer.The isotopic composition of sulfur is quite variable but demonstrates patterns consistent with the above scenario for deep-ocean oxygenation, providing further insights into the nature of ocean chemistry. The isotopic composition of sulfide in pre-Gaskiers sediments is consistently greater than zero, indicating relatively small fractionations from seawater sulfate of around 18 10 per mil (Fig. 3C) [the isotopic composition of seawater sulfate from 590 to 560 Ma is well constrained at between 22 and 28 per mil (32)]. This, combined with generally low concentrations of organic carbon and sulfide, is consistent with low rates of sulfate reduction under sulfate-limiting concentrations. Previous modeling (33) suggests that such low fractionations should occur with submillimolar sulfate concentrations. Higher fractionations in the Gaskiers, and particularly in the Drook Formation, demonstrate a change in the sulfur cycle. Indeed, the higher post-Mall Bay fractionations are consistent with an increase in sulfate concentration, which allows the expression of higher fractionations when compared with those produced with low sulfate levels. This pattern of increased fractionations also occurs with sediments deposited in association with and immediately after the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations (34) and is thus a general feature of Neoproterozoic glacial and postglacial deposits.To explain these increased fractionations, we suggest that glacial melting increased the nutrient load to the ocean. This stimulated primary production and carbon burial and thus increased atmospheric oxygen levels. Increased oxygen enhanced the oxidative weathering of sulfide to sulfate on the continents, thus increasing the flux of sulfate to the ocean and marine sulfate concentrations. The presence of anoxygenic photosynthetic biomarkers in post-Sturtian and post-Marinoan deposits argues against substantial ocean oxygenation after the earlier Neoproterozoic glaciations (35, 36), but the post-Gaskiers event was sufficient to result in oxygenation of the deep ocean. A return to much lower fractionations in post-Mistaken Point sediments could reflect a return to lower marine sulfate concentrations or, perhaps more likely, a reduction in isotope fractionation as might be expected with higher rates of sediment deposition and increased rates of sulfate reduction in a delta-front environment (33).Our evidence for deep-water oxygenation in the post-Gaskiers ocean may place some constraints on the minimum level of atmospheric oxygen at this time. We reason as follows: Organic matter produced in the surface ocean consumes oxygen during degradation as it falls through the water column. In the modern ocean, oxygen concentrations reach a minimum at depths of 500 to 1500 m (37). The magnitude of the oxygen deficit is about 40 to 100 1/2M in the North Atlantic and 100 to 300 1/2M in the North Pacific (37). If we assume that the ocean structure was similar to its structure today and that the Drook and Briscal Formations were deposited in water depths of 500 to 1500 m, then oxygen deficits would have ranged somewhere between 40 and 300 1/2M. If we take 40 1/2Mas the most conservative estimate, then at least this much O2 was dissolved in the waters supplying the deep ocean. Probably a bit more oxygen was required, given that the Ediacara biota would have likely needed 10 to 20 1/2M for their respiration (38), which we add to our minimum estimate of the oxygen content of the water supplying the deep ocean. At present, deep water is formed at high latitudes with an air-saturated O2 concentration of 325 1/2M. If we require a minimum of 50 1/2MO2 in this water, then we need to saturate with atmosphere containing greater than 15% of present day oxygen levels. Thus, 15% of present day oxygen levels is a minimum estimate for post-Gaskiers atmospheric O2.In the Avalon region, this oxygenation was stable and persisted for at least 15 million years. In our preferred scenario, this oxygenation was widespread, marking the first time that oxygen concentrations reached levels permissive for the metabolism of large multicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes. If so, evolution into this new permissive ecology could have been quite rapid (7), resulting in the emergence of the Ediacara biota within 5 million years (1, 2), and recognizable motile animals within another 20 million years (3, 4). In another scenario, the Ediacaran biota populating Avalonia evolved earlier, perhaps before the Gaskiers glaciation, and migrated to Avalon after oxygenation of the local environment. The available data support the first scenario, but further exploration of pre-Gaskiers ocean chemistry and biology will help to elucidate the possibility of the second.
AbstractA cause-and-effect understanding of climate influences on ecosystems requires evaluation of thermal limits of member species and of their ability to cope with changing temperatures. Laboratory data available for marine fish and invertebrates from various climatic regions led to the hypothesis that, as a unifying principle, a mismatch between the demand for oxygen and the capacity of oxygen supply to tissues is the first mechanism to restrict whole-animal tolerance to thermal extremes. We show in the eelpout, Zoarces viviparus, a bioindicator fish species for environmental monitoring from North and Baltic Seas (Helcom), that thermally limited oxygen delivery closely matches environmental temperatures beyond which growth performance and abundance decrease. Decrements in aerobic performance in warming seas will thus be the first process to cause extinction or relocation to cooler waters.Climate change is projected to affect individual organisms, the size and structure of their populations, the species composition of communities, and the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Effects include pole-ward or high-altitude shifts in the distribution of ectothermic animals (1). A comprehensive mechanistic understanding has so far been lacking (2) but is needed for prediction of climate change effects. Physiological studies can address the mechanisms and reasons for the thermal sensitivity of organisms and their life stages.In aquatic animals, a decrease in the capacity to perform aerobically (a drop in aerobic scope) characterizes the onset of thermal limitation at both ends of the thermal envelope [pejus thresholds Tp, fig. S1 (3-6)]. The reduction in aerobic scope is caused by limited capacity of circulatory and ventilatory systems to match oxygen demand. Such a constraint affects all higher functions (muscular activity, behavior, growth, and reproduction) and might thereby shape the long-term fate of species. Aerobic scope becomes minimal beyond low or high critical temperatures (Tc). Survival is then passive and time-limited, supported by anaerobic metabolism and protection of proteins and membranes by heat shock proteins and antioxidative defense. Thermal tolerance is hierarchical, with narrowing windows from molecular to cellular to systemic levels (6). Temperate species are able to acclimatize and shift the thermal window through changes in mitochondrial densities as well as other molecular to systemic adjustments of functional capacities (3, 6-10) (fig. S1). Limits to acclimatization are set by trade-offs at various structural and functional levels that constrain the width of the thermal window, for example, through the trend to minimize energy turnover in relation to climate variability (9, 10).We investigated thermal limitation of the common eelpout, Zoarces viviparus, in its southernmost distribution area, the German Wadden Sea (part of the southern North Sea) during summer and thereby tested the ecological relevance of the concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (fig. S1). During the past 40 years, water temperatures in the German Bight increased by 1.13C (at Helgoland Roads). Cold winters with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) around -1C had occurred about once every 10 years up to 1944 but were experienced only once since 1960 (11). Models predict further SST increments for the next 90 to 100 years, by about 1.6 to 3.0C in the northern and even by 3.0 to 3.9C in the shallower southern North Sea (12), accompanied by rising sea levels (13 to 68 cm by 2050) and an increasing frequency of storm events (13).Comparison of existing data sets indicates that field observations can be explained by the eelpout's physiological responses to warming (Fig. 1). The relative abundance of the nonmigratory eelpout decreases upon warming (5-year running means, data from 1954 to 1989, Fig. 1A) (14, 15), reflecting a higher mortality in hot summers. Reduced field abundance coincides with reduced growth of laboratory-maintained, temperature-acclimated individuals (Fig. 1B). Individual growth is a key parameter shaping population growth and depends on aerobic scope. Lopsided growth curves result from the exponential rise in net aerobic scope upon warming, which is counterbalanced by the concomitant exponential rise in baseline metabolic costs (Fig. 1). Both abundance and growth begin to fall beyond upper pejus temperatures (Tp) (Fig. 1, C to E), reflecting the species-specific limits of acclimation capacity.

(A) The negative correlation between summer water temperatures and relative abundance indicates heat-induced mortality of eelpout in the Wadden Sea [5-year running mean, recalculated from (14, 15) and weather data licensed by DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst)]. Data were fitted to Ar(T)= Armax[1 - ek(T-To)] where Ar(T) is the relative abundance depending on temperature (Armax = 10.173; k = 0.377; To = 20.853, r = 0.7130, and P SD). Data were fitted to the equation dL(T)= F1(T)+ F2(T)= (A1eB1T + C1)+(A2eB2T + C2) with dL(T) = daily growth rates at maximum food supply. The first term, F1(T) = A1eB1T + C1, represents the temperature dependence of aerobic processes supporting growth performance. The second term, F2(T)= A2eB2T + C2, represents the parallel, exponential rise in processes limiting aerobic scope and thus growth capacity (A1 = 0.9901, B1 = 0.0667, C1 = -0.3953, A2 = -0.1942, B2 = 0.1299, C2 = -0.3953, r = 0.9823, and P SD from (32)].

Data were fitted to A(Tmax-1)= C1eC2/C3T where A(Tmax-1) is the abundance depending on maximum temperature of the previous summer (fitting parameters C1 =1.2*10-7, C2 = 240.83, C3 = 0.6686, r = 0.6599, and P < 0.01). The putative upper Tc (Fig. 1) is indicated by a vertical line. Thermal sensitivity is likely to be enhanced at large body sizes. In contrast to eelpout from the Baltic or from colder regions like the Russian White Sea, eelpout of the Wadden Sea only reach a maximum body length of about 23 cm at a maximum age of 3 to 4 years (20). A preliminary analysis of seasonal changes in size frequency distribution (fig. S2) shows that older specimens (larger than 20 cm) have low overall abundance and thus high mortality rates. High mortality of large fish is probably not associated with predation, which usually occurs during early life stages (21). Rather, the oxygen-limitation model predicts that temperature-dependent aerobic limits are experienced earlier by larger than by smaller individuals (22). In fact, thermal sensitivity of growth or exercise was found to be enhanced in large compared with small individuals of various fish species (23, 24). Thermal limits depicted in Figs. 1, 2, 3 are valid for specimens of about 23 cm body length (compare with fig. S2). Mild summers, with temperatures regularly beyond Tp of large fish, can therefore be interpreted to cause mortality of this size class (Fig. 3 and fig. S2). Because of wider thermal windows in smaller specimens, these temperatures still allow for population growth, seen especially during the mild summer of 1998 (Fig. 2). The earlier loss in aerobic scopes of large individuals indicates that specimens do not grow beyond oxygen-dependent size limits set by temperature such that this size group displays low abundance all year round (fig. S2). The species finally experiences a net reduction in abundance (Fig. 1A) when smaller individuals are also affected and population loss during hot summers exceeds yearly population growth. In conclusion, harmful effects of warming set in beyond pejus temperatures. Only summers hotter than critical temperatures of the larger specimens (Figs. 1, 2, 3) entail the full range of thermal stress phenomena depicted in fig. S1. The mismatch in oxygen supply versus demand thus becomes effective at the ecosystem level before the onset of anaerobic metabolism or of thermal damage (Td in fig. S1) and also before critical thermal maxima (CTmax) traditionally determined in thermal biology (25).Overall, the agreement of thermal limits operative in the field with the lab-determined pejus range supports previous studies, which interpreted thermal limitation in aquatic ectotherms to start with limited oxygen supply capacity (3-6, 16-18) (Fig. 1, C to E). Accordingly, pejus limits are the earliest limits experienced by the whole organism in the field. Decrements in aerobic performance cause reduced growth and enhanced mortality first among larger specimens. A reduction in abundance results when all size groups of a population are affected. Residual variability in the data suggests that not only the temperature value itself but also the length of exposure is crucial in setting mortality. The data did not reveal an influence of the shift to milder winters. Furthermore, population growth depends on food supply, which in turn influences aerobic performance and thermal sensitivity. Potential additional components in field tolerance still need to be identified. However, we suggest that reduced aerobic performance beyond pejus limits enhances sensitivity to other, more obvious mechanisms eliciting mortality (predation, starvation, or disease). These influences would display their inherent variability and thereby enhance the variability in the temperature-dependence of abundance.Matching thresholds in field and laboratory data highlight the ecological relevance of the concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance. Adaptation to climate variability involves adjustments of functional capacity in general and, specifically, in the components of aerobic metabolism, of oxygen supply capacity, and of associated costs. Trade-offs in thermal adaptation processes and in organismic energy budget shape the width of thermal windows, with consequences for biogeography (1), growth performance, development, fecundity, recruitment, life-styles, and life-history evolution (9, 10, 26, 27). Widths and locations of tolerance windows on the temperature scale may change or shift during ontogeny (26). At the ecosystem level, species-specific biogeographical ranges differ but overlap and imply that variable thermal windows and sensitivities cause variability in distribution shifts (1), species composition, seasonal timing, and associated mismatch phenomena in species interactions as in a food web. For example, the shift from larger (Calanus finmarchicus) to smaller (C. helgolandicus) copepod fauna in the southern North Sea caused reduced food availability for Atlantic cod (G. morhua) (28). This regime shift was largely determined by different thermal windows of the two copepod species (29). Warming-induced reductions of cod abundance are thus caused both directly [via thermal sensitivity of cod (30)] and indirectly [via the food web (28)] but based on the same physiological principles. Overall, the concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance can provide an integrative framework for developing a cause-and-effect understanding of the influence of climate change and variability on marine ecosystems, including food web structure, recruitment success, and fish landings (30).
AbstractIn legumes, Nod-factor signaling by rhizobia initiates the development of the nitrogen-fixing nodule symbiosis, but the direct cell division stimulus that brings about nodule primordia inception in the root cortex remains obscure. We showed that Lotus japonicus plants homozygous for a mutation in the HYPERINFECTED 1 (HIT1) locus exhibit abundant infection-thread formation but fail to initiate timely cortical cell divisions in response to rhizobial signaling. We demonstrated that the corresponding gene encodes a cytokinin receptor that is required for the activation of the nodule inception regulator Nin and nodule organogenesis.The development of nitrogen-fixing nodules on roots of leguminous plants commences with a molecular dialogue between the host plant and a compatible strain of rhizobia, leading to the synthesis of bacterially encoded lipochito-oligosaccharide signaling molecules, the Nod factors (NFs). Plant plasma membrane-derived structures called infection threads (ITs), which originate within root hairs of the host root in a NF-dependent manner, act as conduits for rhizobia to enter the root tissues and to progress toward the root cortex where a nodule primordium (NP) has been initiated. The release of bacteria from ITs into the cytosol of a subset of NP cells and subsequent cellular specialization of both symbionts lead to the formation of fully functional nitrogen-fixing organs, the root nodules (1).The initiation of cell divisions for NP organogenesis is presumed to arise from the relay of a signal from the epidermally perceived NFs to the root cortex. Several genes in the NF-dependent signaling pathway have been identified, including putative NF receptors (2-4) and a number of downstream elements (5-12). Deleterious mutations in any of these genes abolish bacterial entry into the root and NP development, indicating a crucial role for NF signaling in both processes.The identification of plants that spontaneously form nodules (13-15), together with the observations that ectopic application of cytokinins (16) or auxin transport inhibitors (17) to the root surface lead to the development of nodule-like structures, demonstrates that the machinery required for NP development is intrinsic to the plant. Consequently, the NF pathway is presumed to trigger nodule organogenesis by regulating the endogenous plant mechanism; however, the nature of the mechanism involved remains unclear.We performed a screen for genetic suppressors of the Lotus japonicus har1-1 hypernodulation phenotype that identified three allelic suppressor lines characterized by a low-nodulation phenotype and an excessive formation of ITs. The corresponding locus was named HYPERINFECTED 1 (HIT1) (18). Further detailed phenotypic analysis, performed in both double (hit1 har1-1) and single (hit1) mutant backgrounds, showed that the three suppressor lines had indistinguishable mutant phenotypes, with the bacterial root invasion by way of ITs intact and the timely onset of associated cortical cell divisions for NP organogenesis aborted. The hit1-1 har1-1 and hit1-1 mutants were chosen as reference lines.When analyzed 10 days after inoculation (dai) with a Mesorhizobium loti strain carrying a constitutive hemA::lacZ reporter gene fusion, the most noticeable feature of hit1-1 har1-1 roots was hyperinfection (Fig. 1A and fig. S1A). The large number of ITs that formed in the hit1-1 har1-1 mutant roots originated within curled root hairs, but their progression toward the root cortex was blocked at the interface between the epidermis and the cortex (Fig. 1B). Infrequent ITs that escaped this early blockage and managed to penetrate within the hit1-1 har1-1 root cortex looped frequently, suggesting that they were misguided (Fig. 1C). In spite of abundant infection events at the root epidermis, the root cortex of the hit1-1 har1-1 mutant failed to initiate NP (Fig. 1C). By 14 dai, many ITs overcame the initial blockage and progressed deeper into the mutant root (Fig. 1D). Cortical cell divisions were initiated coincident with the accumulation of ITs within the root cortex, but NP did not develop (Fig. 1, D and E).

In hit1-1, an initial lack of NP formation in response to rhizobial infection (fig. S1B) was accompanied by the early onset of hyperinfection (fig. S1A) with a large number of ITs located within the root cortex (fig. S1C). Most root cortical cells associated with ITs in hit1-1 and hit1-1 har1-1 remained small and uncolonized; M. loti was confined to ITs (fig. S1D). Occasionally, a local release of bacteria from clustered ITs resulted in enlarged and often flattened nodules (fig. S2, A and B), giving rise to the low-nodulation phenotype (fig. S2C). Intermittently, we also observed the development of nodules similar to those in the wild-type roots in both hit1-1 and hit1-1har1-1 (fig. S2B).We further investigated a role for the HIT1 locus in NP organogenesis by studying Early Nodulin 40 (ENOD40) and Nin expression, two markers for NP initiation (12, 20). Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that steady-state levels of the corresponding transcripts in the inoculated roots were strongly reduced in the hit1-1 har1-1 compared with those of the har1-1 parental line, although this difference was not statistically significant between inoculated hit1-1 and wild-type roots (fig. S3, A and B). We concluded that the presence of a functional HIT1 locus is required for normal ENOD40 and Nin expression during the organogenesis of NPs, at least in the har1-1 hit1-1 background.Additional validation of HIT1 function in nodule organogenesis was provided by the analysis of the L. japonicus root hairless (Ljrhl1-1) and hit1-1 double mutant. In response to inoculation with M. loti, Ljrhl1-1 initially develops a large number of uncolonized NPs, a consequence of the absence of root hairs and associated ITs (21). We reasoned that if HIT1 mediates nodule primordia organogenesis, the presence of a mutant hit1-1 allele should prevent or notably attenuate NP formation in Ljrhl1-1. The analysis of the Ljrhl1-1 hit1-1 mutant showed that the development of NP was almost entirely aborted, providing strong evidence for the indispensable role of HIT1 in nodule organogenesis (Fig. 2). The hit1-1 phenotype resembled the infection-thread "symbiosis" proposed to have been a precursor to nodulation (22). Could HIT1 be the missing evolutionary link?

Error bars show means 95% CI (n =20). To begin addressing this question, we set out to map-base clone the HIT1 locus. While this work was in progress, Jens Stougaard's group at Aarhus University (Denmark) cloned the L. japonicus Spontaneous nodule formation 2 locus (13), renamed as Lotus histidine kinase 1 (Lhk1) (23), which is localized to the same genetic interval on chromosome IV as HIT1. Given the opposing nodulation phenotypes of snf2 and hit1-1, we tested the hypothesis that hit1 mutants represent loss-of-function alleles of Lhk1.Lhk1 specific primers were used to amplify the analogous genomic region from the three hit1 lines. In all three lines, mutations were found that were predicted to result in premature stop codons (Fig. 3A). This finding, along with the ability of a wild-type Lhk1 gene to complement the hit1-1 har1-1 and hit1-1 phenotypes in transgenic L. japonicus hairy root experiments (fig. S4), confirmed the identity of the underlying gene as Lhk1. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

This frame shift results in a premature stop codon 45 base pairs (bp) downstream. hit1-3 has a transition from C4922 to T resulting in a premature stop codon before the REC domain.

NAA, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid Because the hit1-1 allele carried a G1695-to-A nucleotide substitution in the splice donor site of intron four, we used oligonucleotide primers flanking this site to amplify the corresponding cDNA. Seven aberrant hit1-1 splice variants were identified (Fig. 3B). In addition, a polymorphic species was found among the PCR products. A search for the corresponding L. japonicus genomic sequence identified a previously unrecognized gene, here named Lhk2 (Lotus histidine kinase 2), of which the predicted product showed 85% identity at the amino acid level with LHK1. Whereas Lhk1 transcripts were present in roots, nodules, and shoots (Fig. 3C), the Lhk2 mRNA was detectable only in roots (fig. S5).Analysis of the full-length Lhk1 cDNA revealed a 2979-base pair open reading frame encoding a predicted protein of 993 amino acids (Fig. 3A). The LHK1 protein had 64% identity with the Arabidopsis cytokinin histidine kinase receptor AHK4, and 49 and 45% identity with AHK2 and AHK3, respectively. Similar to LHK1, LHK2 was more closely related to AHK4 than to other Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors (fig. S6).When expressed in the sln1 yeast strain carrying a lethal mutation in SLN1 histidine kinase (24), Lhk1 rescued the growth of the yeast strain in a cytokinin-dependent manner, demonstrating that LHK1 is a cytokinin receptor (Fig. 3D). In agreement with this notion, roots of hit1-1 mutants exhibited strong insensitivity to exogenously applied cytokinin (Fig. 4A). A similar cytokinin-insensitive root phenotype was observed in all three hit1-1 har1-1 double-mutant lines (fig. S7). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 4. (A) hit1-1 roots are insensitive to exogenously applied cytokinin. (B) qRT-PCR showing significant attenuation (*P 95% CI. (C) The proposed role of LHK1 in NF-induced nodule organogenesis. Perception of NF by a presumed NFR1 and NFR5 receptor complex stimulates local cytokinin biosynthesis in, or redistribution of cytokinin to, the root epidermis and cortex (29). This is perceived by LHK1, which activates Nin expression in the root cortex leading to initiation of nodule organogenesis. Because the accumulation of Nin and ENOD40 transcripts was significantly attenuated in the hit1-1 har1-1 mutant, we next tested whether exogenous application of cytokinin regulates expression of these genes in the wild-type roots. ENOD40 has been shown to be induced by external application of cytokinin to the roots in several legume species (25), and this was also the case in L. japonicus, although the overall induction of ENOD40 was rather modest (fig. S8A). In contrast, 50 nM benzyl adenine (BA) increased the steady-state level of Nin transcript by a factor of 20 (fig. S8A). This induction required de novo protein biosynthesis (fig. S8B). In hit1-1 roots, BA-stimulated accumulation of Nin transcripts was significantly diminished in comparison with wild-type roots, indicating that the high level of Nin expression requires the functional Lhk1 (Fig. 4B).NF signaling regulates Nin expression (3, 15), which is required for the formation of ITs in the root epidermis and initiation of nodule primordia organogenesis in the root cortex (12). Our data indicate that although necessary for Nin expression and nodule organogenesis, Lhk1 is not required for IT formation (Fig. 4C). The reported partitioning of Nin expression between the root epidermis and cortex could provide a plausible explanation for this apparent conundrum (3, 15, 26). Nin expression, supporting IT formation, may be regulated by an Lhk1-independent mechanism in the root epidermis, possibly involving another cytokinin receptor. Diminished nodule organogenesis in hit1-1 har1-1 and hit1-1 likely restricts local and/or systemic feedback mechanisms that limit root susceptibility to Rhizobium infection, resulting in hyperinfection (Fig. 4C).The LHK1 homologs, such as LHK2 and LHK3, are likely to function as cytokinin receptors, which may explain a leaky (formation of some nodules) symbiotic phenotype and lack of more general developmental abnormalities in mutants carrying hit1 alleles. The snf2 mutant described in the accompanying manuscript (23) and strongly reduced nodulation in Medicago truncatula plants carrying a MtCREI silencing construct (27) further demonstrate that cytokinin sensing is required to stimulate nodule development. Together, these results specify that the regulators of cytokinin biosynthesis and/or action are crucial downstream targets of NF perception (Fig. 4C) and that recruitment of a cytokinin receptor could have been an essential event during the evolution of nitrogen-fixing nodule symbiosis.
AbstractLegume root nodules originate from differentiated cortical cells that reenter the cell cycle and form organ primordia. We show that perception of the phytohormone cytokinin is a key element in this switch. Mutation of a Lotus japonicus cytokinin receptor gene leads to spontaneous development of root nodules in the absence of rhizobia or rhizobial signal molecules. The mutant histidine kinase receptor has cytokinin-independent activity and activates an Escherichia coli two-component phosphorelay system in vivo. Mutant analysis shows that cytokinin signaling is required for cell divisions that initiate nodule development and defines an autoregulated process where cytokinin induction of nodule stem cells is controlled by shoots.Differentiated plant cells have an unusual capacity for rejuvenating by dedifferentiation and subsequent differentiation to form new organs or complete plants. In the model legume Lotus japonicus (lotus), nodule organogenesis is initiated by dedifferentiation of root cortical cells followed by cell proliferation, establishing a cluster of meristematic cells that give rise to the nodule primordium. The developmental process is triggered by compatible Mesorhizobium loti bacteria synthesizing lipochitin-oligosaccharide nodulation factor (Nod factor) acting as a mitogen and/or morphogen when recognized by the host plant Nod factor receptors, NFR1 and NFR5 (1, 2). Bacterial invasion of primordia occurs via infection threads progressing through root hairs into the root cortex. Ultimately, rhizobia released from infection threads are endocytosed into cells, which become the infected nitrogen-fixing nodule cells. At the same time, pattern formation and cell differentiation specify tissue and cell types of the new specialized organ, which in turn supplies the plant with nitrogen fixed by endocytosed bacteria.To dissect the genetic regulation of cellular dedifferentiation and meristem formation, we isolated lotus mutants developing root nodules spontaneously. The snf2 (spontaneous nodule formation) mutants develop white rhizobia-free nodules in the absence of M. loti (Fig. 1, A and B). Detailed histological analysis of nodule sections demonstrates that spontaneous nodules are genuine nodules with an ontogeny and physiology similar to rhizobially induced nodules (3). The snf2 allele is monogenic dominant, and inoculation of snf2 mutants with M. loti results in development of normal nitrogen-fixing root nodules, which strongly suggests the presence of a gain-of-function mutation in this allele. Genetic mapping of snf2 and sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosome clones identified a homolog of Arabidopsis histidine kinase genes (AHK) encoding cytokinin receptor proteins (fig. S1A). In light of physiological studies on phytohormones in nodulation (4, 5), this histidine kinase was a likely candidate gene, and the corresponding gene region of snf2 was sequenced. A single nucleotide transition (C to T), resulting in replacement of a conserved leucine 266 by phenylalanine (L266F), identifies snf2 as an allele of a lotus histidine kinase (Lhk1) gene. Alignment of genomic and cDNA sequences defined a primary structure of Lhk1 consisting of 11 exons (fig. S1B). Steady-state levels of Lhk1 transcripts in different plant organs were determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Lhk1 was expressed at the highest level in roots, nodules, and leaves, but transcripts were present in all organs tested. (Fig. 2A).

Constructs carrying either the snf2 mutant gene or the wild-type Lhk1 gene were transformed into wild-type roots using Agrobacterium rhizogenes. To assure reliable transfer to transgenic roots of the gene constructs used throughout this study, they were integrated directly into A. rhizogenes transferred DNA (T-DNA) by using a recombination approach (6, 7). Thus, they were transformed into plant cells together with the T-DNA, which gave rise to transgenic roots at the hypocotyl wound site. An Lhk1 gene segment and the corresponding snf2 gene segment were introduced, and nodulation was scored in the absence of rhizobia. Spontaneous nodulation was observed on transgenic roots transformed with the snf2 construct, whereas the Lhk1 wild-type gene was unable to confer spontaneous nodulation (table S1 and fig. S2). This differential response illustrates the effect of the dominant snf2 mutation and confirms that spontaneous nodulation is caused by a single amino acid substitution in the cytokinin receptor. The absence of nodules on the normal root systems, which served as internal controls for the A. rhizogenes-induced snf2 transgenic roots, and the lack of rhizobia in the nodules that were formed on the snf2 transgenic roots show that they were indeed spontaneously formed nodules.An open reading frame of 2979 nucleotides is predicted in the Lhk1 cDNA clone. The conceptual cytokinin receptor protein (LHK1) consists of 993 amino acids (Fig. 3). At the N terminus, two membrane-spanning segments are located between amino acids 37 and 57 and between amino acids 328 and 357. Located between these segments are motifs characteristic of cytokinin-binding (CHASE) domains. This predicted extracellular domain is followed by a putative intracellular histidine kinase and a receiver domain. These domains are characteristic of two-component regulatory systems operating through phosphorelay. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

The histidine kinase domain is bold and underlined. The histidine kinase adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) domain is bold. The receiver domain is bold and italics. Comparative analysis defines LHK1 as a member of the cytokinin receptor family (fig. S3). Among the three Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors, LHK1 has 68% identity to AHK4/(Cre1), which is important for normal root development and serves a function in perception of externally supplied cytokinin (8). The leucine 266 replaced by a phenylalanine in the snf2 allele is part of a conserved motif shared among the extracellular CHASE domains of histidine kinase receptors (fig. S3). Spontaneous nodulation resulting from an amino acid change located in the CHASE domain suggested a cytokinin-independent function caused by the L266F substitution. To test this hypothesis, we assayed the in vivo activity of lotus wild-type and gain-of-function receptors using the two-component phosphorelay assay developed in E. coli (9). Functional expression of a cytokinin receptor in an E. coli strain lacking the RcsC sensor, which normally regulates extracellular polysaccharide synthesis, allows cytokinin perception to be read out as -galactosidase activity from a cps::lacZ fusion. Expression of the mutant L266F protein does indeed induce -galactosidase activity in the absence of cytokinin (Fig. 4A). In contrast, wild-type LHK1 induced -galactosidase activity in a cytokinin-dependent fashion (Fig. 4A). Quantitative determination of -galactosidase activity in E. coli cultures shows that L266F-expressing cells have three times the -galactosidase activity that control cells and cells expressing wild-type LHK1 have (Fig. 4B). Cytokinin addition results in a twofold induction of -galactosidase activity in LHK1 cells, whereas L266F cells respond with only a marginal increase in activity. These results demonstrate that LHK1 is a cytokinin receptor and that the L266F receptor exhibits cytokinin-independent activity at a level comparable to the cytokinin-induced activity of the wild-type receptor. We propose that the extracellular CHASE domain, normally binding cytokinin to activate the kinase (10-12), in the L266F mutant receptor is locked within an active conformation. This hypothesis would explain both the genetic dominant nature of the snf2 allele and the phosphorelay assay results. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 4.

T-z, trans-zeatin. (C) Model for functional role of Lhk1 in nodulation. Recognition of Nod-factor by NFR1 and NFR5 induces Nod-factor signal transduction, including calcium spiking and CCaMK kinase activity. A localized increase in cytokinin levels perceived by the LHK1 receptor then leads to cortical cell dedifferentiation and cell cycle activation. snf2 acts independently of cytokinin but still requires Nin, Nsp2 genes for nodule organogenesis. Arabidopsis ahk2 ahk3 ahk4 triple mutants display a reduced number of root vascular cell files, because periclinal procambial cell divisions are impaired (13). snf2 mutant roots have the opposite phenotype with extra layers (Fig. 1, C and D). In explants cultivated without phytohormones (Fig. 1, I and J), cell proliferation was even more pronounced. Additional cell layers originating from periclinal divisions were observed, together with an increase in vascular cell numbers (Fig. 1, E and F). In order to examine possible global effects on cell differentiation, we monitored the in vitro performance of snf2 and wild-type hypocotyl and root explants (Fig. 1 and fig. S4). The overall hormone dose response is similar. However, in line with the cytokinin-independent response, snf2 explants survive better at high auxin and develop less callus on cytokinin (Fig. 1, G and H).Cytokinin-induced changes in cellular processes in plants are accompanied by increased expression of type-A response regulator (ARR) genes (14). Among the type-A genes, ARR5 is a rapidly induced response gene, and an Arabidopsis ARR5 promoter fused with the Gus (-glucuronidase) reporter gene (GUS fusion) was expressed during nodulation (15). Because the L266F receptor protein has cytokinin-independent activity in the E. coli assay, we determined transcript levels of a lotus ARR5 homolog named Lrr5 (Fig. 2). Following the examples from previous analyses of the complex cytokinin circuitry in Arabidopsis (16, 17), we determined transcript levels in both intact plants and in vitro cultivated plant cells in order to capture the dynamics and the range of cytokinin regulation. Lrr5 transcript in root explants of snf2 mutants incubated without hormones was found to be two times that of wild-type explants, whereas cytokinin addition increased Lrr5 transcript level two- to threefold in both (Fig. 2B). Cytokinin treatment of roots increased the Lrr5 transcript level in snf2 and wild-type roots, but no difference in expression was detected between untreated snf2 and wild-type roots (Fig. 2C). Cytokinin also regulates expression of the Lhk1 gene and induces a rapid increase in Lhk1 gene transcripts after treatment in both wild-type and snf2 mutants (Fig. 2D). We also tested whether the lotus Nin gene known to be required for initiation of nodule primordia was ectopically expressed in snf2 roots. As shown in Fig. 2E, the Nin gene is up-regulated by cytokinin, and the transcript levels in untreated snf2 roots were significantly different from those of wild-type roots. No ectopic expression of Nin in root explants of snf2 mutants incubated on hormone-free medium was detected (Fig. 2F). Attenuation of the cytokinin response pathway, as previously described in Arabidopsis exposed to cytokinin (16, 17), was also observed in lotus wild-type roots and was even more pronounced in snf2 (Fig. 2, C and E). Thirty minutes after exposure to exogenous cytokinin, a sevenfold increase in the steady-state level of Lrr5 transcript was detected in snf2 roots. In spite of the continuous presence of cytokinin, this initial induction was attenuated at later time points, and only a twofold increase in transcript level was found after 8 hours. In Arabidopsis, attenuation of responses to cytokinin is mediated by a complex feedback mechanism. The cytokinin oxidases, which by themselves are cytokinin inducible, and a range of negatively acting response regulators, including ARR5, which also negatively autoregulate their own transcription, were shown to be involved (16, 17). In the gain-of-function snf2, the cytokinin hypersensitivity (fig. S5) and the presence of the LHK2 and LHK3 receptors (18), which remain cytokinin-dependent, appear to reset the balance point of negative regulation at a level where the transcriptional up-regulation of Lrr5 in untreated snf2 roots is relatively small or undetectable. Although transcriptional changes in the snf2 mutants were limited, plant growth is strongly affected by external cytokinin. In line with the cytokinin-independent activity of the gain-of-function receptor observed in the E. coli assay (Fig. 4A) and in the in vitro culture experiments (Fig. 1, H and J; Fig. 2, B, D, and E), snf2 shoot and root growth was hypersensitive to cytokinin (fig. S5). Prolonged exposure of wild-type plants (8 weeks) to lower cytokinin levels than those used in the experiment shown in fig. S5 did lead to development of small "bumps" that resembled nodule primordia.The phenotype of snf2 mutants suggests that cytokinin signaling acts downstream of Nod-factor signal transduction. To test this hypothesis, the snf2 gene construct was transformed into mutants of the Nod-factor signal transduction pathway and in mutants impaired in downstream genes. snf2-mediated spontaneous nodulation in nfr1-1, nfr5-2 Nod-factor receptor single and double mutants lacking the earliest electrophysiological responses (1, 2) demonstrates a function for Lhk1 downstream of Nod-factor signal perception. The signal transduction symRK mutants lacking Ca2+ spiking (19) and ccamk (Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) mutants, which have been suggested to be unable to interpret Ca2+ spiking (20, 21), also develop spontaneous nodules in snf2 transgenic roots. Incidentally, these results provide independent evidence for snf2-mediated spontaneous nodulation. The nfr1, nfr5, symrk, and ccamk mutants are unable to form nodules in response to rhizobia inoculation. Thus, nodule formation on the snf2 transgenic roots could not have resulted from contaminating rhizobia. In nin and nsp2 mutants arrested before initiation of cell division induced by Nod-factor signaling, no spontaneous nodules were observed in snf2 transgenic roots. Because A. rhizogenes-induced roots only develop when the hypocotyl wound site infection is used in lotus and because the snf2 gene construct was integrated into the T-DNA, these results show that cytokinin signal perception acts upstream of cell division initiation (table S2). Furthermore, evidence for a central role of cytokinin and cytokinin perception downstream of Nod-factor signal transduction comes from the additive effect of snf1-1 and snf2 mutations. The snf1-1 mutants synthesize a CCaMK protein impaired in autophosphorylation (20, 21) and develop an average of 7 0.9 (95% confidence interval) spontaneous nodules, whereas snf2 mutants develop 3 0.5. The snf1-1 snf2 double mutants exceed both with 17 0.9 spontaneous nodules. Parallel signaling cannot be excluded, but more likely, the deregulated signaling in snf1 results in a local increase in cytokinin levels transcriptionally up-regulating snf2 (Fig. 2D) and amplifying spontaneous nodulation. The previously reported expression of a Nin-GUS promoter fusion in snf1 nodule primordia and the absence of epidermal expression in snf1 roots (20) further suggest cytokinin signaling is a cortical response. Conversion of cortical cells into nodule stem cells or subsequent organ development seem therefore tightly controlled. We tested this in a hypernodulating har1-1 mutant (22). Homozygous snf2 har1-1 double mutants developed an average of 14 1.4 spontaneous nodules, whereas snf2 mutants developed an average of 3 0.5, and har1-1, none (fig. S6). This indicates that only a few cells dedifferentiate or that only a few dedifferentiated cells sustain cell divisions during the snf2 nodule-initiation process. The shoot controlled autoregulation of the root nodule number (22) is thus acting downstream of cytokinin signaling-induced activation of root nodule founder cells (Fig. 4C).From Arabidopsis and tobacco, there is evidence for cytokinin regulation of cell cycle phase transitions (23) and for overlapping roles for three AHK receptors in maintaining stem cells and cell divisions during organ formation (13). Phytohormones have also been implicated in nodule organogenesis. Applications of auxin transport inhibitors resulted in empty nodule-like structures, which suggested that local inhibition of auxin transport (24) sensitizes cells for division. Other experiments showed that externally supplied cytokinin induces cortical cell division and activation of Enod12, Enod40, and Enod2 genes (4, 25), and expression of a cytokinin biosynthesis tzs gene in a nodulation-deficient Sinorhizobium meliloti resulted in nodule-like structures (5).Here we show conclusively that cytokinin signaling plays an important role in plant meristem formation and is directly involved in initiating root nodule organogenesis. The opposite phenotype effects of the snf2 gain-of-function and hit1 loss-of-function mutations reported in the accompanying paper (18), together with the reduced nodulation observed after down-regulation of the corresponding gene in Medicago (26), clearly demonstrate that cytokinin signaling is necessary and sufficient for the dedifferentiation and cell proliferation leading to root nodule formation.
AbstractDendritic cells (DCs) process and present self and foreign antigens to induce tolerance or immunity. In vitro models suggest that induction of immunity is controlled by regulating the presentation of antigen, but little is known about how DCs control antigen presentation in vivo. To examine antigen processing and presentation in vivo, we specifically targeted antigens to two major subsets of DCs by using chimeric monoclonal antibodies. Unlike CD8+ DCs that express the cell surface protein CD205, CD8- DCs, which are positive for the 33D1 antigen, are specialized for presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. This difference in antigen processing is intrinsic to the DC subsets and is associated with increased expression of proteins involved in MHC processing.Lymphoid organ DCs are composed of distinct subsets (1-5). In the spleen, two major types of DCs are found: The first is positive for the CD8 marker and the C-type lectin CD205 (CD8+DEC205+), and the second lacks CD8 but expresses the antigen recognized by the 33D1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) CD8-33D1+. These subsets reside in different anatomic locations-CD8+DEC205+ DCs are in the T cell zone, whereas CD8-33D1+ DCs are in the red pulp and marginal zone-and the two can be further distinguished by a number of surface markers (4, 5) (Fig. 1, A to C, and fig. S1). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to targeted antigen in vitro.

Cells were gated on CD11c+CD8- and CD11c+CD8+ DCs. CD8+DEC205+ DCs appear to be specialized for uptake of dying cells and play a unique role in resistance to certain viral infections (6-8). Notable among the other distinctions between the two cell types is the suggestion that CD8+DEC205+ DCs are specialized for cross-presentation, which is the ability to process nonreplicating antigens for presentation to T cells by class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHCI) (7-12). However, a direct comparison of the capacity of the two subsets to process antigen in vivo has been lacking.We identified the antigen recognized by the 33D1 mAb through a combination of gene array and candidate gene approaches and found it to be dendritic cell inhibitory receptor-2 (DCIR2) [Fig. 1, D and E; fig. S2 and (13)]. DCs are highly enriched in lectins, and in addition to DCIR2 and DEC205, the CD8+DEC205+ and CD8-33D1+ DCs differed in expression of a number of other lectins (Fig. 1D and fig. S2B). To evaluate regulation of antigen processing and T cell activation by the two DC subsets in vivo, we delivered antigens to each cell type in situ using chimeric DEC205 (14) and 33D1 antibodies (15) [fig. S3 and (13)]. Delivery of ovalbumin (OVA) antigen by the injected antibodies was monitored after DC purification by antigen presentation in vitro to transgenic OT-I or OT-II T cells specific for OVA peptides presented on MHC class I or MHC class II, respectively (14, 16). As previously reported, purified DCs targeted with DEC205-OVA in vivo induced both OT-I and OT-II T cell proliferation in vitro, although the extent of OT-II proliferation was relatively modest (Fig. 1F) (14, 16). In contrast, antigen delivered with the 33D1 antibody elicited high levels of OT-II but no detectable OT-I T cell responses (Fig. 1F). B cells and other non-DCs purified from mice injected with DEC205-OVA or 33D1-OVA failed to present OVA either to OT-I or OT-II T cells (Fig. 1F). The specificity of targeting was made apparent by the specific localization of DEC205 on CD8+DEC205+ DCs and 33D1 on CD8-33D1+ DCs after chimeric antibody injection in vivo (Fig. 1G). In addition, both antibodies were internalized by the cells, although the kinetics of 33D1 internalization was slower than for DEC205, and the amount of internalized DEC205-OVA was greater than the amount of internalized 33D1-OVA (Fig. 1H and fig. S4). Neither antibody altered DC maturation status, as determined by surface expression of MHCII, CD40, CD69, CD80, and CD86 (fig. S5). Finally, the difference in presentation between the two DC subsets in vivo was not due to a difference in their ability to present peptides once processed, because the two were equivalent in presentation of antigen to the same transgenic T cells when processed peptides were added to in vitro cultures (fig. S6). We conclude that DCs targeted by DEC205-OVA or 33D1-OVA in vivo are distinct in their ability to present antigen on MHCI and MHCII in vitro.To examine T cell activation in response to antigen presentation in vivo, we labeled OT-I and OT-II T cells with 5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl diester (CFSE), a reporter dye for cell division, and monitored the cells after adoptive transfer to a new host (13). As observed in vitro, DEC205-OVA induced MHC class I-restricted OT-I responses with greatest efficiency, whereas 33D1-OVA primarily elicited MHC class II-restricted OT-II responses (Fig. 2A). By in vivo dose-response experiments, comparing cell division and T cell expansion after transfer, 33D1-OVA was a factor of 10 less effective in presentation to OT-I T cells and 10 times as effective in presentation to OT-II T cells as DEC205-OVA (Fig. 2, A and B). Antigen presentation after a single administration of either DEC205-OVA (16) or 33D1-OVA was long-lasting (Fig. 2C). Thus, OT-I T cells proliferated in response to antigen even when they were transferred 10 days after DEC205-OVA injection, and OT-II T cells proliferated when cells were transferred up to 5 days after 33D1-OVA injection (Fig. 2C). However, T cells proliferating in response to antigen delivered by targeting antibodies in the steady state were rapidly deleted, and the remaining cells were unresponsive to further stimulation in vitro (Fig. 2, D and E). In contrast, when antigen delivery by 33D1 was combined with DC activation by CD40, the expanded T cell population persisted and demonstrated strong recall responses to antigen challenge in vitro (Fig. 2, F and G). Thus, antigen delivery to CD8-33D1+ DCs in vivo results in preferential MHCII-restricted antigen presentation. Nevertheless, delivery of antigens to both DC subsets in the steady state leads to T cell tolerance, whereas targeting in combination with DC maturation by CD40 ligation leads to expansion of T cell clones that remain responsive to antigen.

PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. To examine the mechanism responsible for differential antigen presentation by the two DC subsets, we assayed formation of MHCII hen egg lysozyme (HEL) peptide complexes (MHCII-p) by using a mAb specific for this complex (17). CD8+DEC205+ DCs showed small amounts of surface MHCII-p 3 hours after injection of DEC205-HEL, but this was no longer visible after 1 day (Fig. 3A). In contrast, CD8-33D1+ DCs targeted with 33D1-HEL antibodies displayed much higher levels of MHCII-p after 3 hours and continued to display MHCII-p 2 days after targeting (Fig. 3A, arrows). MHCII-p formation was specific for the targeting antibody and independent of DC activation because mice deficient in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) were indistinguishable from controls in this assay (Fig. 3, A and B) (13). We conclude that antigens delivered by the 33D1 antibody to CD8-33D1+ DCs in the steady state are processed and transferred to the cell surface as MHCII-p more efficiently than are antigens delivered by DEC205 to CD8+DEC205+ DCs.

Arrows indicate significant staining as compared with controls. To determine whether the observed differences in antigen processing were due to cellintrinsic differences between the two DC subsets, we produced transgenic mice that express human DEC205 (CD11c-hDEC205 B10.BR transgenic mice) on both DC subsets and performed targeting experiments with an hDEC205 antibody that does not cross-react with mouse DEC205 (18) [fig. S7; note that CD11c-hDEC205 mice show position effect variegation and hDEC205 is equally expressed and variegated on both DC subsets (13)]. Both subsets were specifically targeted by hDEC205-HEL in transgenic mice but not wild-type (WT) controls in vivo as measured by surface staining with antibodies to immunoglobulin G (anti-IgG) (fig. S8). However, only CD8-33D1+ CD11c-hDEC205 transgenic DCs showed high levels of MHCII-p after hDEC205-HEL or MHCII-p presentation after hDEC205-OVA injection (Fig. 3C and fig. S9). To further compare presentation by DEC205-OVA and 33D1-OVA targeting in the same cell, we infected bone marrow-derived DCIR2-negative DCs with a retrovirus encoding DCIR2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (fig. S10A). Infected cells expressing the retrovirally encoded DCIR2 were then sorted on the basis of GFP expression and targeted with DEC205-OVA or 33D1-OVA in vitro. Following DC maturation with LPS, presentation to OT-II T cells was equivalent for the two targeting antibodies [fig. S10B and (13)]. This shows that class II presentation by mature bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) was independent of whether they were targeted by DEC205-OVA or 33D1-OVA. We conclude that the difference in MHCII processing by DC subsets is an intrinsic property of the cell and not due to differences between the receptors targeted by DEC205 or 33D1 mAbs.Many of the proteins that regulate MHCI and MHCII processing pathways have been described and their expression documented in DCs (19, 20). To determine whether the two DC subsets show systematic intrinsic differences in expression of components of the MHCI and MHCII processing machinery, we performed microarray experiments on mRNA isolated from the two DC subsets (Fig. 4, A and B; fig. S11A) (13). We found that the two DC subsets differentially express components of the MHCI and MHCII processing pathways in a manner consistent with their ability to produce MHCII-p and induce CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. CD8+DEC205+ DCs, which are biased for MHCI cross-presentation, were enriched in Tap1, Tap2, calreticulin, calnexin, Sec61, ERp57, ERAAP, as well as cystatin B and C, all of which are involved in MHCI presentation or inhibition of enzymes that process peptides for MHCII presentation (19, 20) (Fig. 4B). In contrast, CD8-33D1+ DCs, which are biased for MHCII presentation, were enriched in cathepsins C, H, and Z, asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), GILT, and H2-Mbeta 1, all of which are implicated in the MHCII antigen processing pathway (19, 20) (Fig. 4A). To confirm that these proteins were differentially expressed in DC subsets, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis for intracellular H2DM (Fig. 4C) and Western blotting experiments. MHCI processing-associated proteins were expressed at higher levels in CD8+DEC205+ DCs (Fig. 4E and fig. S11B), whereas MHCII processing proteins were expressed at higher levels in CD8-33D1+ DCs (Fig. 4, C to F, and fig. S11B). We conclude that the differences in expression of proteins involved in antigen processing in CD8+DEC205+ and CD8-33D1+ DCs are consistent with preferential processing of antigens for presentation by the two cell types.

(D) Lysosomal marker LAMP-1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1) and (F) -actin are shown as loading controls. Efficient antigen presentation by DCs requires regulated lysosomal protein degradation (21, 22). However, the requirements for presentation on MHCII and cross-presentation on MHCI differ in that MHCII processing occurs inside endosomes, whereas cross-presentation on MHCI necessitates antigen escape from the endosome into the cytoplasm to gain access to the proteasome and TAP transporters (19, 20, 23-25). Elegant in vitro experiments with cultured DCs show that during DC development, antigen presentation is regulated through control of lysosomal processing and MHCII cell surface transport (21, 22, 26-28). Cultured immature DCs capture antigen but only process and present it on MHCII after exposure to inflammatory stimuli or TLR ligation (22). This unique ability to sequester antigens may be important for their preservation during DC transit from sites of inflammation to lymphoid organs and might facilitate the escape of antigen from endosomes to the cytoplasm or endoplasmic reticulum for crosspresentation (21). However, DCs that fail to degrade antigen might also be suboptimal producers of MHCII-p. Our experiments show that in the intact host, this problem is resolved by producing a subset of DCs specialized for maximizing MHCII presentation. Although CD8+DEC205+ DCs can initiate immune responses by presenting on MHCII, CD8-33D1+ DCs excel in producing MHCII-p. This specialization may have important implications for understanding the initiation of T cell responses in vivo and for rational vaccine design.
AbstractEndoplasmic reticulum-localized protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B terminates growth factor signal transduction by dephosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). But how PTP1B allows for RTK signaling in the cytoplasm is unclear. In order to test whether PTP1B activity is spatially regulated, we developed a method based on Forster resonant energy transfer for imaging enzyme-substrate (ES) intermediates in live cells. We observed the establishment of a steady-state ES gradient across the cell. This gradient exhibited robustness to cell-to-cell variability, growth factor activation, and RTK localization, which demonstrated spatial regulation of PTP1B activity. Such regulation may be important for generating distinct cellular environments that permit RTK signal transduction and that mediate its eventual termination.Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is widely used by eukaryotic cells to transduce signals, but the dynamic interplay between receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) remains poorly understood (1, 2). The protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) resides on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (3, 4) and helps terminate signaling by multiple RTKs, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (5). Previous reports demonstrate that RTK signaling occurs at the plasma membrane and endosomes (6), and its termination occurs along the ER surface (7-11). Because PTP1B has much higher specific activity than typical RTKs in vitro (12, 13), uniformly high PTP1B activity along the ER could prevent endosomal RTK signaling. To account for compartmentalized RTK signaling, we hypothesized that PTP1B might exist inside cells as spatially separated subpopulations with different kinetic properties.To test this hypothesis, we developed an imaging approach based on Forster resonant energy transfer (FRET) to spatially resolve enzyme-substrate (ES) interactions and thereby to monitor enzyme activity in live cells (Fig. 1A) (11). We tagged PTP1B with a donor chromophore by fusion to a genetically encoded fluorescent protein, and conjugated the substrate, a synthetic phosphotyrosine-containing peptide, to an acceptor chromophore (Fig. 1B). For Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the steady-state fraction () of ES complex to total enzyme (E0) is as follows: (1) where S is the substrate concentration, and KM is the Michaelis-Menten constant. The fraction can be mapped across the cell by quantitatively imaging FRET with the use of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) (14-16).

An alternative peptide (1-cP) with an aminohexanoic (Ahx) acid linker and lacking the cysteine is not shown. For some live-cell experiments, 2-cP was coupled to the cell internalization sequence from the third helix of the Antennapedia homeodomain (26).

We first tested whether formation of the ES intermediate could be detected by FRET in vitro. To stabilize the ordinarily transient ES intermediate and thereby to facilitate FRET detection, we used the purified enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged catalytically impaired mutant of PTP1B that retains substrate-binding ability (residues 1 to 321, PTP1BD181A, in which Ala181 was substituted for Asp) (17, 18). Indeed, FRET in the ES complex was apparent, as indicated by increased acceptor (lissamine) emission, quenching of donor (EGFP) fluorescence (Fig. 1C), and decreased donor fluorescence lifetime (fig. S3). Consistent with the PTP catalytic mechanism, the thiol-reactive compounds iodoacetamide and sodium pervanadate (19), as well as the transition-state analog sodium vanadate, all attenuated FRET (Fig. 1D and fig. S3). By contrast, incubation of the peptide with the wild-type catalytic domain resulted in a transient FRET signal, which decayed with a velocity consistent with previously determined catalytic parameters [KM of 2.2 1/2M, and the catalytic rate of the enzyme (kcat) of 67 s-1; fig. S4] (13, 20).Next, we analyzed interactions between PTP1B and the synthetic substrate in COS-7 cells, which endogenously express EGFR (21). We compared the EGFP fluorescence lifetime in cells ectopically expressing EGFP-PTP1BWT with and without microinjected caged substrate (1-cP) (Fig. 2A). As expected, no FRET signal was observed before uncaging, because the cage on the phosphate moiety prevents ES interaction (22) (Fig. 2B, top). Ultraviolet (UV)-induced uncaging resulted in a significant drop of EGFP fluorescence lifetime, only in substrate-injected cells (Fig. 2B, middle), indicative of FRET. This interaction was specific for the phosphorylated peptide, as no FRET was detected when EGFR-deficient MCF-7 cells were loaded with the cognate nonphosphorylated peptide (see below). A transient, uniform distribution of ES complex was observed 15 s after uncaging, which evolved to a persistent gradient of ES complex by 1 min (Fig. 2C), with higher ES complex at the cell periphery. This slow equilibration time scale is inconsistent with the high kcat measured in vitro (67 1/2M s-1 turnover for 1 1/2M of ES complex), which suggests that kcat in vivo is 1/2m.

Error bars show the SD of individual cell traces (n =5). The establishment of a stable ES complex concentration after stepwise uncaging of the substrate in COS-7 cells implied a steady-state maintained by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle (Fig. 2E). Notably, peptides containing the DADEYL phosphorylation motif can bind and be phosphorylated by the high basal kinase activity of the EGFR in the absence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) (12, 18, 23). To verify that ES complex was maintained at a steady state by a kinase-phosphatase reaction cycle, we tested whether nonphosphorylated substrate could be phosphorylated in cells. Loading a membranepermeant, nonphosphorylated analog of the substrate (peptide 2-OH) into MCF-7 cells ectopically coexpressing the citrine variant of yellow fluorescent protein fused to PTP1BD181A (citrine-PTP1BD181A) and cyan fluorescent protein fused to EGFRWT (EGFRWT-CFP) resulted in accumulation of substrate-PTP1BD181A complex over time. This complex was not observed in the absence of EGFRWT or when the kinase-dead mutant EGFRV741G was transfected (Fig. 2F). Irreversible PTP inhibitor sodium pervanadate or the specific EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) also decreased FRET between citrine-tagged PTP1B and the substrate (figs. S7 and S8) in EGFRWT-expressing MCF-7 cells, which confirmed the dynamics of the reaction cycle.Because this reaction cycle establishes a steady-state concentration of the phosphorylated substrate, we could analyze the spatial distribution of ES complexes. Notably, the steady-state concentration of the ES complex was higher at the cell periphery than in the perinuclear region (Fig. 3, A to C). Using Eq. 1, a map of KM/S for PTP1BWT was constructed (Fig. 3D), which revealed that the peripheral pool of PTP1B operated in a near-saturation regime (i.e., low KM/S). An ES gradient dependent on KM and S could reflect spatial regulation of PTP1B catalytic activity (by its effect on KM). Alternatively, such a gradient could result from a gradient of phosphorylated peptide and/or differential competitive binding of PTP1B to endogenous substrates. The latter was ruled out by the uniform ES distribution observed in cells transfected with citrine-PTP1BD181A (Fig. 3, A to C), which binds the synthetic substrate reversibly and competitively (Fig. 1D and fig. S5). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3. Differential regulation of PTP1B activity in subcellular compartments.

Scale bars, 50 1/2m. Systems with spatially partitioned activities-e.g., a plasma membrane-bound kinase and a uniform ER-bound phosphatase (fig. S11)-are expected to generate steady-state substrate concentration gradients (24, 25). In order to explore the contribution of a substrate gradient to the steady-state spatial distribution of an ES complex, we formulated a reaction-diffusion model of the proposed kinase-phosphatase reaction cycle (11). Our model, assuming the in vitro measured kinetic parameters, indeed generated a precipitous gradient (25) of the phosphorylated substrate close to the plasma membrane and also a gradient in ES complex (Fig. 4B). However, the maximal steadystate level of the ES complex predicted by the reaction-diffusion model was much lower than that observed experimentally (Fig. 3). Instead, the observed ES gradient could only be generated by the model if the specific activity (kcat) of the phosphatase was 1/2m to the plasma membrane at 20 1/2m. All values are from observed or in vitro measurements, except for the phosphatase and (dashed green line), which were both reduced by a factor of 100.

Additionally, a factor-of-20 increase of the kinase is given (dashed red line, divided by 8). (D) Two-dimensional projection of ES/E0 for the corresponding curves in (C). Such a buffering mechanism could be provided by spatial regulation of the catalytic activity of PTP1B, which can well account for the observed robustness of the ES gradient over a large range of parameters (Fig. 4, C and D) (11). Here, the lower activity of the membraneproximal PTP1B pool puts it into a near-saturation regime, whereas higher activity of the central pool buffers the system to perturbations over a larger range (Fig. 4, C and D, and figs. S15 to S17) (11). Spatial regulation also would explain the persistence of the ES gradient in cells with different shapes, as well as in cells with nonstimulated EGFR localized to endomembranes (fig. S8).Persistence of the ES gradient was also observed after EGFR activation by EGF, which increases its kinase activity by up to a factor of 5 (13). At early times after stimulation, only a slight change in the gradient was observed (Fig. 3E), consistent with the spatial regulation model. Further increase in the steady-state level of ES complex in the cell interior observed at later times could be explained by the redistribution of activated EGFR after endocytosis.Spatial regulation of PTP1B is likely important for its role in compartmentalized RTK signaling. In the absence of stimulus, the low activity of membrane-proximal PTP1B is still sufficient to counteract basal EGFR activity and, thereby, to maintain a low level of EGFR phosphorylation on endomembranes. With growth factor stimulation, the low activity of the plasma membrane-proximal PTP1B pool also may permit signaling from phosphorylated EGFR in endosomes. Transport of the ligand-activated EGFR to the perinuclear region (8, 9), where PTP1B activity is higher, would then lead to signal termination. Further studies are required to elucidate the biochemical mechanism underlying the spatial regulation of PTP1B activity. Our method for imaging ES intermediates could be used to study the localization and regulation of potentially any enzymatic activity in live cells, providing quantitative information on enzyme catalysis with high specificity.

Please see:Corrections and Clarifications - March 02, 2007 Abstract A new combined rhenium-osmium- and platinum-group element data set for basalts from the Moon establishes that the basalts have uniformly low abundances of highly siderophile elements. The data set indicates a lunar mantle with long-term, chondritic, highly siderophile element ratios, but with absolute abundances that are over 20 times lower than those in Earth's mantle. The results are consistent with silicate-metal equilibrium during a giant impact and core formation in both bodies, followed by post-core-formation late accretion that replenished their mantles with highly siderophile elements. The lunar mantle experienced late accretion that was similar in composition to that of Earth but volumetrically less than (1/20.02% lunar mass) and terminated earlier than for Earth. The histories of Earth and the Moon are intrinsically linked, with a catastrophic giant impact considered to be the most likely mode of origin of the Earth-Moon system (1, 2). After this event, both bodies experienced early [4.53 0.01 gigayear (Gyear)] global-scale differentiation (3, 4), forming metallic cores and silicate mantles and crusts. However, uncertainty exists in several aspects of these planetary evolution models. For example, the influence of core formation and the relative timing and composition of late-accretion material to the Moon's mantle from bodies striking the surface are poorly constrained (5, 6). This has important consequences for metal-silicate equilibrium (5), the so-called late veneer on Earth (7) and its apparent relation to the rise of life (8), and lunar late heavy bombardment (9). Highly siderophile elements (HSEs: Re, Au, Ir, Os, Ru, Rh, Pt, and Pd) and the Re-Os isotope system embedded within these elements offer a means to address these problems, because they are effective tracers of the early stages of planetary evolution (10). They are sensitive to metal-silicate equilibria during core formation and to the subsequent addition of primitive, HSE-rich undifferentiated materials to silicate mantles after core segregation. The abundances of HSEs in Earth's mantle (1/20.008 * C1 chondrite) are elevated relative to those predicted from metal-silicate equilibrium (0.00001 * C1 chondrite). Although high-temperature, high-pressure silicate-metal equilibrium can account for depletion of HSEs in planetary mantles, it cannot explain the chondritic proportions of HSEs in Earth. This observation is considered to be primary evidence for late accretion after core formation (6, 7). In contrast, great uncertainty exists regarding lunar-mantle HSE abundances (5). Determining lunar-mantle HSE contents has been problematic because of a lack of direct mantle samples, together with low HSE abundances in mare basalts, melts of the lunar interior, and potential mantle proxies. Severe leaching of pyroclastic glasses, which have experienced meteoritic and magmatic condensate contamination, and analysis of a dunite cumulate point to lower HSE abundances for the Moon's mantle as compared with Earth's, but more substantive data are needed to draw any conclusions (11). We report precise Os-isotope- and HSE-abundance data (table S1) for five basalts from the Apollo 15 mission, six from Apollo 17, and six lunar basalts of meteoritic origin from LaPaz, Bolivia, that were obtained by using an ultra-low-blank, isotope-dilution digestion technique (12). In contrast to pyroclastic glasses, the selected samples are unaffected by meteoritic contamination (13-15) and hence offer an opportunity for determining the HSE and Os-isotope compositions of the lunar mantle. A striking feature of the data is that lunar basalts have lower HSE abundances than terrestrial mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) with comparable-to-lower MgO contents (Fig. 1). In some samples, Ir-Pt-group elements (I-PGEs: Os, Ir, and Ru) are fractionated to lower abundances than Pd-PGEs (P-PGEs: Pt and Pd), but others have relatively flat, unfractionated PGE patterns. Fractionation of I-PGE and P-PGE results from extensive partial melting or crystal/melt separation, in which more compatible I-PGEs remain in the mantle residue or are trapped within early-formed minerals (16, 17). Variations in mare-basalt HSE abundances and PGE patterns can be explained by fractionation of olivine and chromite, as recognized from their major-element compositions (18, 19). LaPaz basalts have large I-PGE and P-PGE fractionations relative to Apollo basalts (Fig. 1), consistent with their incompatible-element-enriched and -fractionated nature (13). Measured 187Os/188Os compositions for Apollo 15 and 17 basalts (0.1265 to 0.1729) are nearly chondritic as compared with the LaPaz basalts (0.1697 to 0.4628), in agreement with a preliminary study of two of the basalts (20). Initial 187Os/188Os ratios range from within 5% of chondritic values to values far below the solar system initial composition. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

Another remarkable attribute of the data set is the ubiquitously low Re contents of lunar basalts, which were previously ascribed to low oxygen fugacity (fO2) in the lunar mantle, affecting HSE partitioning during melting (20). However, postulated redox effects on Re compatibility during melting have not been experimentally verified and assume similar S contents for the lunar and terrestrial mantles (20). Studies of mare-basalt olivine melt inclusions indicate that the lunar mantle has S contents that are two to three times lower than in the terrestrial mantle, such that f Smaybemore dominant than fO2 in controlling HSE partitioning (21). Our data demonstrate that Pt and Pd are also anomalously low in the lunar mantle, as are Ir, Ru, and Os. PGEs are unlikely to be as redox-sensitive as Re, and hence, our view is that fO2 cannot be the dominant control on low lunar HSE abundances, even if it cannot be ruled out for controlling Re. Samples with low initial 187Os/188Os have low MgO and Os abundances [1 are also evident. The very low Re and Os abundances in these samples make them extremely susceptible to minor Re addition or Os loss [supporting online material (SOM) text]. Their initial 187Os/188Os ratios are too low for their sources to have interacted with a component with low time-integrated Re/Os before magmatism. Although we are not able to conclusively determine whether Re addition or Os loss is responsible, these basalts have obviously experienced a multistage evolution. We classified these basalts as "disturbed" and did not consider them in constraining the evolution of the lunar mantle. Mare basalts with generally higher MgO contents have relatively elevated I-PGE contents (Os >10 ppt), unfractionated PGE patterns with (Pd/Ir)n and (Os/Ir)n close to 1, and initial Os isotopic compositions that are within 5% of chondritic values (Figs. 1 and 2 and table S1). We classified these samples as "undisturbed" (74255, 15016, 15555, and 15596) and used them to consider Osisotope and HSE compositions of lunar-mantle source regions. Undisturbed samples have origins consistent with mantle-derived melts that have experienced olivine and spinel accumulation (19, 20). The effect of this accumulation would be to increase I-PGE abundances (17), thereby flattening PGE patterns. The enhanced I-PGE abundances result in estimates of the probable conservative maxima of lunar-mantle HSE abundances. Near-chondritic Os-isotope ratios of undisturbed basalts indicate derivation from a source that experienced longterm chondritic evolution of Re/Os (and by inference, HSE ratios), which maintained this character through the eruptive duration of the basalts, until at least 1 Gyear after Moon formation.

The lowest measured 187Os/188Os values for mare basalts lie in the range of chondritic compositions, and the primitive upper mantle (PUM) composition is derived from terrestrial-mantle peridotites (SOM text). Number indicates the number of samples analyzed. It is unlikely that HSE ratios would remain close to chondritic values if they were affected by contamination from the lunar crust during the eruption of the basalts (SOM text). The selected samples have been well characterized and show no evidence of crustal or meteoritic contamination (14, 15, 18, 19). Therefore, unfractionated PGE patterns among undisturbed mare basalts probably result from relatively small degrees of melting (1/20.008 * C1 chondrite) and a PGE pattern similar to that of fertile orogenic peridotites (Fig. 3). Regressed data for undisturbed lunar basalts also generate broadly chondritic relative abundances of HSEs, but with all HSE abundances 20 to 40 times lower than terrestrialmantle estimates (1/20.0002 * C1 chondrite, Fig. 3). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3. Estimated lunar- and terrestrial-mantle PGE abundances and patterns versus terrestrial orogenic peridotites. Estimates for mantle compositions were made by regressing Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd, and Re versus MgO data (SOM text and fig. S2). Both lunar and terrestrial mantles have chondritic relative abundances of HSEs, but the Moon's mantle possesses abundances nearly two orders of magnitude less than those of Earth. Calculated concentrations for the lunar mantle are 1/20.2 ng/g Pt; 0.1 ng/g Os, Ir, Ru, and Pd; and 0.01 ng/g Re; 1/20.0002 * C1 chondrite. Three key observations that place important constraints on lunar evolution were predicted from our data set: (i) low HSE abundances, (ii) chondritic HSE proportions, and (iii) the long-term chondritic Os-isotopic composition of the Moon's mantle. Two of these characteristics [(ii) and (iii)] are also shared with Earth and point to similar processes being involved in the formation and evolution of Earth and the Moon. A two-stage evolution is required to explain these observations. Abundances of HSEs were initially lowered in the lunar and terrestrial silicate mantles by metal-silicate partitioning. For both Earth and the Moon, scavenging of HSEs could have occurred through two processes. HSE-depleted mantles may have been inherited during the giant impact, where models predict that nearly all core material for both colliding bodies would have been sequestered into Earth (1, 2). Alternatively, the segregation of cores during planetary differentiation would strip HSEs from silicate mantles. Metal-silicate equilibrium would fractionate HSE ratios, in particular, Re from Os; therefore, a second stage is required to replenish HSEs back to chondritic-relative proportions to ensure a chondritic Os-isotopic evolution for the lunar mantle. For Earth, post-core-formation accretion of 1/20.4% of the mantle mass is thought to have occurred, re-enriching the upper mantle in HSEs by effective mixing of material during mantle convection (6). The observed depletion in lunar-mantle HSEs indicates that the late accretion component was much less important for the Moon. We calculated that the addition of 1/20.02% (1.5 * 1019 kg) of the Moon's mass by accretion of chondritic material would restore chondritic Re/Os and account for the inferred lunar-mantle HSE composition. This is equivalent to an Earth/Moon mass flux ratio of 1/22700, which is considerably greater than the ratio of 30 that was estimated from the gravitational-attraction potential of the two bodies (6). Because the lunar cratering record indicates substantial continued impacts after crust formation, we suggest that the thick, ancient >4.4-Gyear (23) lunar crustplayedakeyroleinisolatingthe lunar mantle early in the late accretion phase of lunar evolution, explaining its limited HSE re-enrichment. The mixing and homogenization of any meteoritic post-core-formation HSE inventory to re-create a chondritic mantle for Re-Os isotopes probably occurred in the 1/20.1-Gyear period between the inception of lunar differentiation [4.53 0.01 Gyear (3)] and the stabilization of the lunar crust (23). This model, which explains the abundances and chondritic ratios of HSEs in lunar basalts, agrees with other physical and dynamical constraints on the formation and evolution of the Moon. Mare-basalt HSE data are, therefore, consistent with the giant impact and magma-ocean differentiation models for the Moon followed by prolonged, higher-volume late accretion that was responsible for elevated HSE abundances in Earth's mantle relative to the Moon.
Abstract We demonstrated that platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts can be stabilized against dissolution under potential cycling regimes (a continuing problem in vehicle applications) by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters. This behavior was observed under the oxidizing conditions of the O2 reduction reaction and potential cycling between 0.6 and 1.1 volts in over 30,000 cycles. There were insignificant changes in the activity and surface area of Au-modified Pt over the course of cycling, in contrast to sizable losses observed with the pure Pt catalyst under the same conditions. In situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and voltammetry data suggest that the Au clusters confer stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential. After Haruta's discovery (1) of the catalytic activity of supported small Au clusters for CO oxidation, there were several reports on the effects of the oxide supports in facilitating this activity (1-3). Other explanations of the activity included the clusters' distinct electronic (4) or chemical properties (5). The mechanism of oxygen adsorption and activation necessary for rapid CO oxidation is controversial and opposite to the observed lack of O2 dissociation on Au single crystals (6). Recently, Chen and Goodman (7) suggested that all reactants adsorb on Au rather than on the oxide support. The metal oxide/support interface boundary sites are believed to be important for stabilizing oxygen-containing reaction intermediates on Au clusters (8). Support effects were reported on the nucleation, growth, and morphology of Au nanoclusters for TiO2 and SiO2 oxides (9). As the underlying surface affects the Au clusters, so the clusters can conversely be expected to alter the properties of the support surfaces. However, such effects have not yet been studied, despite considerable scientific and technological interest. Here we report that Au clusters have a stabilizing effect on an underlying Pt metal surface under highly oxidizing conditions and suppress Pt dissolution during the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) during potential cycling, without decreasing the oxygen reduction kinetics. Fuel cells are expected to become a major source of clean energy (10, 11) with particularly important applications in transportation. Despite considerable recent advances, existing fuel-cell technology still has drawbacks, including the instability of the Pt electrocatalyst for the ORR at the cathode (10). Recent work recorded a substantial loss of the Pt surface area over time in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) (11) during the stop-and-go driving of an electric car; this depletion exceeded the Pt dissolution rates observed upon holding at constant potentials (12) for extended time spans. Our results show promise toward resolving this impediment. The Au clusters were deposited on a Pt catalyst (carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles) through galvanic displacement by Au of a Cu monolayer on Pt (13). Underpotential deposition, which involves a monolayer-limited process at potentials above the thermodynamic values, was used to coat a Pt surface with a monolayer of Cu. To obtain some insights into a possible mechanism of Au cluster formation on Pt nanoparticles, we describe a more tractable model system: depositing Au onto a single-crystal Pt(111) substrate. In addition, the Pt(111) surface is known to form a surface oxide layer that inhibits ORR activity and leads to its possible dissolution. It is likely that Au clusters can affect this process, which can provide information on the stabilization effect. After undergoing several potential sweeps to 1.2 V, the Au monolayer transformed into three-dimensional clusters (Fig. 1). The scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) image shows clusters two to three monolayers thick and 2 to 3 nm in diameter. All potentials are given with respect to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The measurements were carried out at room temperature, unless otherwise indicated. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. STM image (125 * 125 nm) of the Au clusters on a Pt(111) surface, obtained by galvanic displacement of a Cu monolayer by Au. A Cu monolayer was deposited at underpotential on Pt (111). The Au adlayer was subjected to 10 cycles between 0.2 and 1.2 V versus RHE with a sweep rate of 50 mV/s to obtain such clusters. The STM image was acquired at the electrode potential of 0.8 V in 0.1 M HClO4 at room temperature; the tunneling current was 1.24 nA. The Au clusters on carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles were generated using the same method. Because the size of the Pt nanoparticles is about 3 nm, the Au clusters on Au/Pt/C are clearly much smaller than those on Au/Pt(111). We used the adsorption and oxidative desorption of CO to determine the Pt surface area blocked by Au. A thin layer of catalyst was bonded by a thin Nafion film to a glassy carbon disk of a rotating disk electrode. The CO stripping measurements on Pt/C and Au/Pt/C (fig. S1) revealed that the Au clusters in Au/Pt/C covered about 30 to 40% of the Pt surface. We assumed in this calculation that CO is not adsorbed on the Au surface under these conditions. The structure of the Au-modified Pt/C catalyst was examined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Measurements were performed using a high-resolution 300-kV field-emission microscope (JEOL3000F) equipped with an energy filter, an energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer, and an electron energy-loss spectrometer. Low-magnification images (fig. S2) indicate the presence of metal particles averaging 3 to 5 nm in size on 1/250-nm carbon spheres. Figure 2 shows the morphology of two isolated metal nanoparticles on the carbon support. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy applied directly to these particles showed the presence of 10 to 11% Au on Pt. The most frequently observed lattice fringes fit well with the Pt(111) surface. The distinct structures indicated by arrows in Fig. 2 are ascribed to the Au clusters, which appear amorphous rather than crystalline.

High-resolution images (A and B) show atomic rows with spacings that are consistent with the Pt(111) single-crystal structure. A different structure in the areas indicated by the arrows is ascribed to the Au clusters. The in situ extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (fig. S3) of the Pt L3 and Au L3 edges of the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst have an absorption intensity at the Au L3 edge (11,919 eV) that is 1/228% of that at the Pt L3 edge (11,564 eV). The difference between the absorption intensities approximates the composition of the Au/Pt electrocatalyst because of the proximity of Pt and Au absorption coefficients. The mole ratio of bulk atoms to surface atoms for the 2- to 3-nm size of these nanoparticles is 1/240 to 50%. If a 2/3 monolayer of Au is deposited on the surfaces of Pt nanoparticles, the Pt:Au mole ratio must thus range from 1:0.26 to 1:0.33, which is in a very good agreement with the above result of 28% (that is, 1:0.28) from EXAFS spectra. Because Au L3 absorption begins only 355 eV after the onset of the Pt L3 edge, some fluctuations due to photoelectron scattering in the Pt EXAFS spectrum must be superimposed on the Au spectrum. The proximity of the Pt and Au L3 edges makes the analysis of such spectra questionable. Thus, the size of the Au clusters could not be determined. We found that the Pt nanoparticles retain their ORR activity crucial for fuel-cell catalysts after the deposition of Au clusters. On a rotating disc-ring electrode, the activities of Au/Pt/C and Pt/C differed by only 3 mV, expressed as the half-wave potential of these two surfaces (fig. S4). The small difference in the ring currents of the two surfaces corroborates this conclusion. In addition, the ring currents show a negligible generation of H2O2, indicating a four-electron reduction of O2 to H2O on both surfaces. The stabilizing effect of Au clusters on Pt was determined in an accelerated stability test by continuously applying linear potential sweeps from 0.6 to 1.1 V, which caused surface oxidation/reduction cycles of Pt. The surface reaction involves the formation of PtOH and PtO derived from the oxidation of water that causes the dissolution of Pt via the Pt2+ oxidation state (12). We conducted the test by applying potential sweeps at the rate of 50 mV/s to a thin-layer rotating disk electrode in an O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution at room temperature. For comparison, a Pt/C catalyst with the same Pt loading as that in Au/Pt/C was subjected to the same potential cycling conditions. After 30,000 cycles, changes in the Pt surface area and electrocatalytic activity of the ORR were determined. The catalytic activity of Au/Pt/C, measured as the currents of O2 reduction obtained before and after potential cycling, showed only a 5-mV degradation in half-wave potential over the cycling period (Fig. 3A); in contrast, the corresponding change for Pt/C amounts to a loss of 39 mV (Fig. 3C). The same experiment with Au/Pt/C at 60C showed no loss of activity (fig. S5), affording additional evidence for the stabilizing effect of Au clusters on the underlying Pt.

The potential cycles were from 0.6 to 1.1 V in an O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution at room temperature. For all electrodes, the Pt loading was 1.95 1/2g(or10 nmol) of Pt on a 0.164 cm2 glassy carbon rotating-disk electrode. The shaded area in (D) indicates the lost Pt area. Voltammetry was used to determine the Pt surface area of the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C electrodes by measuring H adsorption before and after potential cycling. Integrating the charge between 0 and 0.36 V associated with H adsorption for Au/Pt/C shows no change, indicating no recordable loss of Pt surface area (Fig. 3B). However, for Pt/C, only 1/255% of the original Pt surface area remained after potential cycling (Fig. 3D). As expected, the surface-area measurements are in good agreement with the measured ORR activities. For the Pt/C catalyst (11.9 1/2gPt/cm2), the measured degradation of the half-wave potential (E1/2) after 30,000 cycles (at room temperature) was 39 mV. If the Pt specific activity does not vary significantly with the potential cycling, and assuming a constant Tafel slope b of -120 mV, the remaining Pt surface area after potential cycling can be estimated by using the expression (see the supporting online material) E1/2 = -b * log(SPt/SPt0), where SPt is the Pt surface area after cycling and SPt0 is the initial Pt surface area. For the loss in E1/2 of 39 mV, the calculated value for the remaining active Pt surface area is 47% of the initial one. This is less than the observed 55%, but the difference is not surprising given a possible change of the interfacial conditions during 30,000 cycles and the approximations involved in the calculation. A similar expression for the cell can be found in reference (11). This stabilizing effect of Au clusters and lack of ORR inhibition, despite blockage of approximately one-third of the Pt sites on Au/Pt/C by Au, are intriguing phenomena that may have additional applications beyond fuel cells. To elucidate the origin of the observed stabilization effect of Au clusters, we determined by in situ x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) the oxidation state of Pt as a function of potential for the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C surfaces. The data offer strong evidence of decreased oxidation of Pt nanoparticles covered by Au in comparison with the oxidation of Pt nanoparticles lacking such coverage. In the XANES spectra for Au/Pt/C at the Pt L3 edge (Fig. 4A), the intensity of the absorption bands reflects the depletion of the d band caused by the oxidation of Pt; a very small potential dependence indicates such oxidation. This effect is more evident in the relative change of the x-ray absorption peak intensity of the Pt L3 edge spectra for Au/Pt/C and Pt/C as a function of potential (Fig. 4B). The increase in the intensity of the absorption edge peak for the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst commences at considerably higher potentials than does that for the Pt/C catalyst; thus, the oxidation of Pt nanoparticles modified by Au clusters requires much higher potentials than are necessary for unmodified Pt nanoparticles. The high Pt oxidation potential of the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst (that is, the lower extent of Pt oxidation) is clearly the major mechanism for the stabilization effect of Au clusters. A decreased Pt oxidation can also be discerned from a comparison of voltammetry curves for Au/Pt/C and Pt/C, as well as for Au/Pt(111) and Pt(111). The lower charge associated with the Pt oxidation at the potential region between 0.7 and 1.1 V clearly reveals the reduced oxidation of Au-modified surfaces (fig. S6).

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the binding energies and reactivity of small adsorbates correlate well with the position of mu d on strained surfaces and metal overlayers (16), in accordance with data from numerous experimental studies (17-20). The small Au clusters have more low-coordinate Au atoms than do the extended Au crystal surfaces. Au atoms with low coordination numbers have higher-lying d states, which are more reactive and interact more strongly with the adsorbate states (21). Au clusters on oxide supports can thereby activate molecular oxygen at room temperature (22-24). When Au clusters are bound on a metallic, rather than oxide, substrate, the electronic interactions differ. Roudgar and Gro (25) used DFT calculations to demonstrate a significant coupling of d orbitals of small Pd clusters to the Au(111) substrate. An equivalent type of interaction between Au and Pt can account for the observed stabilization of Pt. When clusters of the softer Au metal are placed on the surface of considerably harder Pt, there is practically no mixing between them. Del Popolo et al. (26) previously reached a similar conclusion regarding Pd on an Au system. The surface alloying of Au with Pt, although unlikely, also would modify the Pt electronic structure toward a lower Pt surface energy, or lower-lying Pt d-band states. The high ORR activity of the Au clusters on a modified Pt/C electrocatalyst is a counterintuitive observation. Au is not an active catalyst for the ORR to H2O; instead, H2O2 is quantitatively generated in a two-electron reduction at most surfaces [except for Au(100) and its vicinal surfaces in alkaline solutions (27)]. Because Pt reduces O2 to H2O in a four-electron process, a decrease of the reduction current for the Pt surface that is one-third covered by a monolayer of Au would be expected. Without this decrease, it appears that Au clusters have a very high activity, in stark contrast to the behavior of the bulk Au or of carbon-supported Au nanoparticles. As discussed above, the mechanism of oxygen activation by Au clusters is controversial. Several researchers ascribed the activity of Au clusters to their interactions with oxides, resulting in charged Au particles (28). In view of our preceding discussion (25), such a process is not likely to occur with Au clusters at metal supports. To explain the observed activity, we might consider an efficient spillover of H2O2 from Au clusters to the surrounding Pt atoms, where further reduction to H2O can take place. Alternatively, if AuOH is formed at certain potentials, it may help in reducing H2O2, as discussed for alkaline solutions (29). Such behavior could account for the negligible loss of activity of the Pt surface toward ORR. Our studies raise promising possibilities for synthesizing improved ORR Pt-based catalysts and for stabilizing Pt and other Pt-group metals under oxidizing conditions.
Abstract and T cells originate from a common, multipotential precursor population in the thymus, but the molecular mechanisms regulating this lineage-fate decision are unknown. We have identified Sox13 as a -specific gene in the immune system. Using Sox13 transgenic mice, we showed that this transcription factor promotes T cell development while opposing T cell differentiation. Conversely, mice deficient in Sox13 expression exhibited impaired development of T cells but not T cells. One mechanism of SOX13 function is the inhibition of signaling by the developmentally important Wnt/T cell factor (TCF) pathway. Our data thus reveal a dominant pathway regulating the developmental fate of these two lineages of T lymphocytes. T cells of the and lineages arise at different stages of ontogeny, preferentially localize to specific tissues, and perform distinct and overlapping immune functions (1, 2). However, aside from their distinct cell-surface antigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs), relatively little is known about the molecular characteristics that distinguish them. A central question in understanding how the two lineages of T cells arise is whether lineage choice in uncommitted progenitors is directed by distinct instructional signals from the TCR or the preTCR (a complex of TCR and the surrogate chain) (3, 4), or if precursors are pre-committed to either lineage before TCR expression (5, 6). Because definitive markers to distinguish and lineages before TCR expression have been lacking, this question has been difficult to resolve. To investigate the lineage-fate decision process at the molecular level, we screened for transcription factors (TFs) that were differentially expressed between and thymocytes and found that Sox13, a high-mobility group (HMG) TF (7), is a T cell lineage-restricted molecule (Fig. 1A) (8). T cell progenitors that seed the thymus follow a defined, multistep differentiation program and are identified by the absence of cell-surface CD3, CD4, and CD8 [triple negative (TN)] molecules. TN cells are further subdivided into TN1 to TN4 by the cell-surface expression pattern of CD25 and CD44. Successful rearrangement and production of the TCR chain at the TN3 stage allows -specific preTCR signaling, promoting differentiation into double-positive (DP, CD4+CD8+) immature -lineage cells. T cell differentiation diverges from this developmental progression between the TN2 and TN4 stages. In the TN population, Sox13 expression was highest in the multipotent progenitors, TN1 and TN2 (Fig. 1B). Its expression was subsequently turned off in differentiating -lineage cells starting from the TN3 stage (Fig. 1B). In the peripheral lymphoid organs, Sox13 expression was detected in T cells but not in T, NK, or B cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the expression of other HMG TFs-Tcf1, Lef1, and Sox4-was detectable in both -and -lineage cells (Fig. 1D). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

(F) Representative RT-PCR for Sox13 and Tcf1 expression in sorted single c-kit+CD44+CD25+ TN2 thymocytes from WT mice (n = 3 independent experiments). The numbers above the lanes indicate individual clones. All 13 -actin+ single cells were Tcf1+, whereas 13 of 28 -actin+ cells expressed Sox13. Sox13 was expressed in cells of Tcr-/- mice and in early fetal thymocytes well before the appearance of DP thymocytes (Fig. 1E) (7), thereby distinguishing it from other -lineage-biased genes (such as Rgs1) whose expression is dependent on conventional DP thymocytes (9). Sox13 expression is also not linked to the specific activation state of lymphocytes shared by "nonconventional" lymphocytes because it was not expressed in intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) (Fig. 1C). Further, Sox13 expression is not linked to TCR rearrangement or expression, indicating that Sox13 expression in the immune system strictly correlates with T cell sublineage but not TCR type (fig. S1). Expression of Sox13 in TN2 cells is consistent with its potential role in early T cell development. These precursors do not exhibit substantial levels of TCR gene rearrangement, and we have previously shown that the developmental potential of TN2 cells is heterogeneous (10). These data, in combination with another recent documentation of the developmental heterogeneity at the TN2 stage (11), suggest that some lineage commitment has already occurred at the TN2 stage. To determine whether expression of Sox13 marks a distinct subset of T precursors, we first established the frequency of Sox13-expressing cells among single TN2 cells. Whereas 100% of single TN2 cells expressed Tcf1, Sox13 expression was detected in only 46% of the clones (Fig. 1F). This result indicates that Sox13 expression is restricted to a subset of TN2 cells, and the determined frequency of Sox13-expressing TN2 cells correlates well with the frequency of bipotent or -lineage-restricted adult TN2 cells, as determined by an in vitro assay (11). At the population level, a TN2 subset biased toward the lineage expressed more Sox13 than did the -lineage-biased TN2 subset (fig. S2). These results support the prediction that Sox13 expression marks cells more likely to become T cells. To assess the function of SOX13 in -versus -lineage development, we generated transgenic (Tg) lines that overexpressed Sox13 in thymocyte precursors. -lineage development was ablated in Sox13Tg embryonic day 17 (E17) fetuses as compared to littermate controls (LMCs) because DP cells were absent. In contrast, cells developed normally (Fig. 2A). T cell-lineage development remained impaired in adult Sox13Tg mice (4 to 8 weeks old), with a decrease in the proportion and number of thymocytes when compared to LMCs. DP cell numbers were reduced by 10- to 50-fold, depending on the age and founder lines (Fig. 2, B and C). Again, despite an increase in the percentage of -lineage cells in Sox13Tg mice, the absolute number of these cells was comparable to that in the LMCs (Fig. 2, B and C).

(F) sqRT-PCR of TN and thymocytes from WT mice and DP thymocytes from LMC and Sox13Tg mice to confirm select genes altered in Sox13Tg DP thymocytes identified by Affymetrix arrays (fig. S4). Some HMG TFs have been implicated in the modulation of the cell cycle and in survival (12-14). Accordingly, there was a 2.5-fold decrease in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in the TN cells in Sox13Tg mice as compared to LMCs (Fig. 2D). Because the vast majority of proliferating TN cells in the normal thymus are -lineage preTCR+ thymocytes, these results suggest that SOX13 inhibits the proliferative burst associated with the -lineage TN-to-DP developmental transition. In addition, a greater than twofold increase in the frequency of apoptosis was observed in the DP and TCR+ thymocytes of Sox13Tg mice relative to LMCs, as evidenced by the increased frequency of cells expressing Annexin V, an early marker of apoptosis (Fig. 2E), suggesting that SOX13 regulates cell survival. Concordantly, the deficit in DP thymocytes in Sox13Tg mice was partly reversed by the expression of an anti-apoptotic Bcl2 transgene (fig. S3). To test whether SOX13 is also required to impose a -lineage molecular differentiation program on developing T cells, we compared global gene-expression profiles of sorted -lineage DP thymocytes from Sox13Tg mice and LMCs. The majority of differentially expressed genes [70 or 57% of genes whose expression was decreased or increased, respectively, in Sox13Tg DP cells relative to the baseline wild-type (WT) DP cells] were also the genes differentially expressed between normal and DP thymocytes (Fig. 2F and fig. S4). The most notable gene among the differentially expressed genes was that encoding TCR, the prototypic T cell-lineage marker, whose expression is normally silenced in -lineage DP cells but was expressed in developing cells in Sox13Tg mice. These findings suggest that enforced expression of SOX13 in -lineage cells is sufficient to impose some aspects of the -lineage molecular trait. The phenotype of Sox13Tg mice resembled that of mice lacking T cell factor 1 (TCF1), another HMG TF essential for Tcell-lineage development (12, 15, 16). Indeed, the expression of the V2-J1 gene rearrangement was evident in Tcells of Tcf1-/- mice (Fig. 3A), suggesting that one function of TCF1 is to repress TCR gene expression in -lineage cells. In addition, TCF1 positively regulated -lineage-specific Cd4 gene expression (17), and Sox13Tg mice exhibited diminished CD4 expression on neonatal DP thymocytes (fig. S5), suggesting an antagonistic interaction between SOX13 and TCF1. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3. SOX13 antagonizes TCF1.

(Right) -catenin binds to p45 TCF1 in corresponding assays. The activity of TCF1 is induced by canonical Wnt signaling by its association with the coactivator -catenin (12, 18, 19). Some Sox genes have been shown to influence Wnt signaling (20, 21), and we tested the possibility that SOX13 functions, in part, by antagonizing TCF1. 293T cells express TCF1 and signaling-competent -catenin in sufficient amounts to activate transcription of a Luciferase reporter gene controlled by TCF binding sites (22). SOX13 inhibited this reporter gene activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Further, SOX13 could down-modulate expression of Ly49a, a known in vivo TCF1 target gene (23), in EL4 T cells (Fig. 3C). We next examined the mechanism by which SOX13 suppresses TCF1 function. In 293T cells, SOX13 was shown to bind full-length TCF1 (the p45 isoform), but not N-terminal truncated TCF1 (p33) that lacks the -catenin interaction domain (Fig. 3D). Moreover, no evidence of direct SOX13 interaction with -catenin or its related protein, -catenin, was detected (Fig. 3D). Hence, SOX13 is the first example of a lineage-specific Wnt/TCF1 antagonist that acts by directly binding and presumably sequestering TCF1 and/or modifying its activity. To determine whether SOX13 is necessary for T cell development, we generated Sox13-deficient mice. Because of as-yet-uncharacterized developmental abnormalities in postnatal Sox13-/- mice (fig. S6), we determined the effect of Sox13-deficiency during embryonic development where there are no overt developmental defects. No significant differences were observed in the proportions of -lineage thymocytes at E18.5 (Fig. 4A). However, there wasa gene dose-dependent decrease in the number and proportion of TCR+ cells in Sox13+/- and Sox13-/- mice as compared to LMCs (Fig. 4, A and B), resulting in a significantly increased ratio of the absolute number of mature -lineage thymocytes relative to TCR+ thymocytes (Fig. 4C). This adverse effect of Sox13 deficiency on T cell development was evident despite the fact that Sox13-/- mice expressed Sox5, the closest relative of Sox13 (24), whose expression pattern is identical to that of Sox13 during mouse T cell development (fig. S6). In addition, Sox13-/- and TN thymocytes exhibited significantly enhanced rates of proliferation (Fig. 4D), a corollary finding to reduced proliferation of TN thymocytes in Sox13Tg mice (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that the developing thymocytes are extremely sensitive to the levels of SOX13 and that SOX13 is necessary for normal T cell development.

The heterogeneous expression of Sox13 in TN2 cells, combined with the asymmetry in the developmental potential of the TN2 subset, indicates that some lineage separation had occurred before TCR rearrangement. The silencing of Sox13 expression may constitute an initial step in the elaboration of the -lineage molecular program. Although this conclusion does not preclude the influence of possibly distinct TCR and preTCR signaling modules in subsequently reinforcing or modifying the lineage-fate decision, the ability of SOX13 to antagonize TCF1 suggests that a simple on/off switch controlling the magnitude of Wnt/TCF1 signaling may be an early, critical regulator of the binary T cell-fate decision process.
Abstract As compared with extensive contiguous areas, small isolated habitat patches lack many species. Some species disappear after isolation; others are rarely found in any small patch, regardless of isolation. We used a 13-year data set of bird captures from a large landscape-manipulation experiment in a Brazilian Amazon forest to model the extinction-colonization dynamics of 55 species and tested basic predictions of island biogeography and metapopulation theory. From our models, we derived two metrics of species vulnerability to changes in isolation and patch area. We found a strong effect of area and a variable effect of isolation on the predicted patch occupancy by birds. Tropical forests are among the world's most threatened ecosystems, which are under severe pressure by human activities, primarily deforestation (1). Deforestation reduces forest area and frequently isolates remaining forest patches. Island biogeography (2) and metapopulation (3) theories predict the effects of reduced area and increased isolation on rates of species extinction and colonization and thus on species occurrence. However, strong tests of these predictions are scarce. Most published inferences about the effects of area and isolation are based on patterns of species occurrence, rather than directly on the dynamic rate parameters (such as extinction and colonization) that produce these patterns. Multiple plausible hypotheses can be developed to explain any such pattern, and pattern-based analyses thus produce weak inferences (4). The few studies that have focused on patch-occupancy dynamics follow observational, rather than experimental, designs at small spatial and temporal scales, and they fail to deal adequately with detection probabilities: the fact that species may be present at a site yet go undetected. The Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) was initiated to test the effects of forest destruction at the patch level in a tropical ecosystem (5). The study, located in the central Brazilian Amazon, involved a reduction in forest area, which was predicted to increase the probabilities of local extinction of species, and isolation of remnant forest patches, which was predicted to reduce species colonization probabilities and increase extinction (2, 3, 6). The combined effects of both factors are predicted to reduce patch occupancy (2, 3). We tested these predictions using data from the diverse bird community while separating inferences about area and isolation, in contrast to more usual approaches that confound these two effects as "fragmentation" (7). The data are of an experimental nature on relevant geographical and temporal scales, and our analysis treats detection probabilities explicitly. A mist-netting program monitored understory birds in 23 primary-forest patches for 13 years (5). All patches were initially in continuous forest, but 11 of them were subsequently isolated by ranchland (two of which are depicted in Fig. 1). Patches were set in size classes of 1, 10, 100, 500, and 600 ha, with the largest isolated patch at 100 ha (table S1). The forest was cleared after monitoring began, permitting inference about the processes of extinction and colonization in isolated and continuous forest patches of different sizes (8). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Two isolated fragments at Fazenda Dimona, Brazil. This aerial photograph of a 10-ha and a 1-ha fragment was taken shortly after isolation. Gaps between the fragment edge and the continuous forest are less than 1 km wide. We used patch-occupancy models (9) to test a priori hypotheses about the influence of patch area and isolation on occurrence dynamics of 55 well-sampled bird species. The models contain four kinds of parameters: initial occupancy (1), local extinction probability ( mu ), local probability of colonization (), and probability of detection given presence (p). We limited our model set to plausible a priori hypotheses about the processes of detection, colonization, and local extinction, rather than conducting exploratory analyses with a larger model set including various combinations of potential covariates (table S2). 1 is a free parameter and is never related to a covariate. p is a function of mist-netting effort and takes different values for different species. We predicted that mu would be related to patch area and isolation in one of three ways: a multiplicative function of patch size and isolation (full interaction model), an additive function of the same two variables, and a function of patch size alone. should be related to isolation, perhaps as modified by regrowth of matrix habitat because some ranchland was abandoned. Colonization is modeled as a function of isolation, regrowth, and the "year 1 effect"-increased colonization by displaced birds immediately after deforestation-taken in five additive combinations. Isolation is a binary variable. We thus fitted 3 * 5 = 15 different models to each species using a maximum-likelihood approach in the program PRESENCE (10). Models were ranked by Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and AIC weight wj for model j (11). We predicted that patch size, independently of isolation, should have a negative effect on mu (2, 3). Isolation, independently of size, should have a positive effect on local extinction via the reduction of the "rescue effect" (6). We also asked three expert neotropical ornithologists to classify the study species into two categories of dispersal ability (low and high). Isolation, through its effects on colonization and local extinction, should be more important for models of poor dispersers than for models of good dispersers. We expected forest regrowth to be more important for poor dispersers than for good dispersers. Among the variables that affect mu and , we predicted that dispersal ability would be the most relevant in the species' responses to deforestation. Other variables may also be relevant, but their predicted effects are typically based on their relationshiptodispersal ability. Thus, rather than testing the relevance of various species classification schemes, we focus here on our a priori prediction about the relevance of dispersal ability. Our analysis follows three steps, all of which are based on fitting models for each species. First, we ask what covariates appear in the top-ranking models of each species. Second, we focus on the single model that fits best across species and examine the signs and magnitudes of covariate effects (slope parameters). Finally, we select one best-fitting model per species and draw inferences based on the estimated local extinction and colonization parameters. Patch isolation appears as a covariate of colonization and/or local extinction in high-ranking models (wj > 0.2) of nearly all, but not all, species (Table 1 and table S3). Patch size, regardless of isolation, seems sufficient to explain the observations on three exception species: Geotrygon montana, Dendrocolaptes certhia, and Hypocnemis cantator. Fifteen species have high-ranking models with an effect of isolation only on local extinction, and five species have high-ranking models with that effect only on colonization. Regrowth enters high-ranking models in two-fifths of the species. Contrary to our expectation, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that regrowth enters high-ranking models of highand low-dispersal species in the same proportions (one-tailed z test, P = 0.33). Likewise, there is no evidence to sustain the prediction that isolation would appear more frequently in high-ranking models of low-dispersal species (one-tailed z test, P =0.97). Inferences are qualitatively the same if highranking models are redefined as having wj > 0.1 or wj > 0.25. Table 1.

Model 6 hypothesizes fixed colonization and an additive effect of size and isolation on local extinction. There is a negative effect of patch size on mu : For all species, larger plots have lower mu values. Isolation shows more variable results, with 36 of 55 species showing a positive slope. As predicted, the effect of isolation on local extinction is positive more often than negative (one-tailed z test, P mu (A and D) and (B and E). D. merula [(A) to (C)] shows a marked effect of isolation both on local extinction and on colonization and a stronger effect on . Estimates for F. viridis [(D) to (F)] vary mostly with patch area. Arrows in (C) illustrate two metrics reflecting use of space: A and I. We use approximate 95% confidence intervals (Fig. 4) to assess whether each metric is significantly different from zero. In agreement with results based on slope parameters and wj, a substantial proportion (29/54) of species is not significantly vulnerable to isolation. There is a higher proportion (36/54) of species with area sensitivity that is significantly different from zero, with two-thirds of these species not being significantly vulnerable to isolation. This result suggests that many species fail to occur in small isolated patches, not because they succumb to the effects of isolation in reducing any rescue effect but because they rarely occupy any small patch (even in continuous forest) just because of their pattern of space use. Management aimed at curbing the effects of isolation (e.g., corridors and edge protection) will have reduced effectiveness for those species that are highly sensitive to area.

Open and solid circles indicate that the approximate 95% confidence intervals of both metrics or of neither metric overlap zero, respectively. Upward and rightward pointing triangles indicate that only the confidence interval of A or I does not overlap zero, respectively. Symbols with arrows indicate point estimates outside the plotted range of the x axis. Our finding that local extinctions are always more probable in small than in large patches is predicted by demographic theory and is evident from the slope parameters of model 6. The role of isolation is less obvious: A predominantly positive but variable effect of isolation on local extinction under model 6 must be qualified by the many low and uncertain estimates of I. Our knowledge of the dispersal abilities of species in undisturbed conditions does not explain the variation in the signs of the slope parameters or in the contributions of the isolation and regrowth covariates to high-ranking models. Either we do not know enough about dispersal abilities-a notion that is widely supported by neotropical ornithologists-or those abilities change in disturbed landscapes to the extent that we cannot use them to predict occupancy parameters under disturbance. Deforestation results in forest-area reduction and isolation of remaining forest patches, and both factors affect occupancy dynamics. This study shows the generality of these effects by showing that they apply to tropical forest landscapes in addition to the temperate landscapes from which most previous inferences have come. The interspecific variation in the effects of isolation on the studied tropical bird community is reminiscent of similar variation reported for avian communities in temperate forests of North America (15). Both the North American study and our more realistic modeling approach report interspecific variation, but they differ in that our finding demonstrated a relatively stronger effect of area than of isolation. We qualify this finding by noting that our data come from a landscape that is dominated by forest. The distance between isolated patches and continuous forest ranges from 150 to 900 m (16). Further forest destruction is expected to result in additional species loss and larger effects of isolation (7, 17).
Abstract RNA interference (RNAi) is a phylogenetically widespread gene-silencing process triggered by double-stranded RNA. In plants and Caenorhabditis elegans, two distinct populations of small RNAs have been proposed to participate in RNAi: "Primary siRNAs" (derived from DICER nuclease-mediated cleavage of the original trigger) and "secondary siRNAs" [additional small RNAs whose synthesis requires an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP)]. Analyzing small RNAs associated with ongoing RNAi in C. elegans, we found that secondary siRNAs constitute the vast majority. The bulk of secondary siRNAs exhibited structure and sequence indicative of a biosynthetic mode whereby each molecule derives from an independent de novo initiation by RdRP. Analysis of endogenous small RNAs indicated that a fraction derive from a biosynthetic mechanism that is similar to that of secondary siRNAs formed during RNAi, suggesting that small antisense transcripts derived from cellular messenger RNAs by RdRP activity may have key roles in cellular regulation. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-triggered gene silencing in eukaryotes appears universally to involve 21- to 25-nucleotide (nt) siRNA effectors. In Drosophila and mammals, siRNAs derive primarily from processing of longer duplexes by DICER nuclease, forming 21- to 25-nt duplexes possessing 5'-monophosphates, 3'-hydroxyl groups, and 2-nt 3' overhangs (1, 2). Along with this "primary" siRNA response, amplification of the RNA trigger population has been proposed to contribute to potency and persistence of gene silencing in several systems (3, 4). Amplification mechanisms are accompanied in some cases by "transitive RNAi" phenomena in which dsRNA matching one mRNA region can silence targets bearing homology to other parts of the mRNA (5-9). Unlike the situationinplantswhere "spreading" of the effector population occurs bidirectionally relative to the target mRNA (6, 8), transitive RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits a strong bias toward sequences upstream of trigger homology (7, 9). Transitive RNAi requires function of a putative RdRP (RRF-1 in C. elegans soma, SDE1/SGS2 in Arabidopsis thaliana), suggesting several conceivable means for secondary siRNA production (6, 7). One possibility is that antisense primary siRNAs could act as primers in the RdRP-mediated synthesis of new dsRNAs on an mRNA template. Alternatively, primary siRNAs may merely guide the RdRP to a target, allowing unprimed synthesis (10, 11) either at the cleaved end of the targeted transcript, at a location close to the trigger-target complex, or at a structure such as a free end that might be revealed as aberrant through consequences of the initial RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)::target interaction. To better understand signal amplification in C. elegans, we characterized small RNAs from animals undergoing RNAi against an abundantly expressed endogenous gene, sel-1 (12). After reverse transcription, 245,420 18- to 25-nt RNAs were sequenced by means of single-molecule pyrosequencing (13). Among these sequences, 534 exhibited either a perfect match (428 instances) or single mismatches (106 instances) to sel-1 mRNA (Fig. 1, A and B). A similar analysis of 1/2850,000 clones from animals not exposed to dsRNA yielded just one sel-1 small RNA (14). Most sel-1 small RNAs induced during interference (483) had an antisense orientation, consistent with previous hybridization-based analyses (7). Of the 51 sense strand clones, 22 showed complementarity to at least one antisense clone. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Distinct RNAi-associated small RNA populations identified by 5'-ligation-dependent and 5'-ligation-independent methods. Small RNAs were isolated from animals in which RNAi had been triggered by dsRNA covering nucleotides 535 to 992 of sel-1 mRNA. (A and B) By the 5'-ligation-dependent method, 51 sense clones (47 within the trigger, 4 downstream) and 483 antisense clones (110 upstream of the trigger, 1 in the trigger/upstream junction, 335 within the trigger, 9 in the trigger/downstream junction, 28 downstream) were obtained. (C) The 127 sel-1-associated small RNAs isolated by the 5'-ligation-independent method. All were antisense: 12 upstream of the trigger, 1 at the upstream/trigger junction, 104 within the trigger, and 3 downstream. We observed an incomplete bias in siRNA positions relative to the trigger; of 138 antisense siRNAs outside the original trigger, 110 (80%) occurred on the 5' side. This bias could certainly account for preferential detection of upstream secondary responses in functional and biochemical assays (7, 9). Twenty-eight observed instances of small antisense RNAs completely downstream of the trigger homology were of particular interest, as these would not have been expected if the sole mode of amplification involved extension by RdRP of existing siRNA triggers that hybridize to the target transcript. Exon-exon junctions offer a unique opportunity to unequivocally distinguish de novo synthesis of antisense nucleic acids from an mRNA template (15, 16). We found 50 sel-1 small antisense RNA sequences that span exon/exon junctions. Of these, 43 fall within the trigger [458 base pairs (bp) of sel-1 cDNA sequence] and thus could have derived directly from triggering dsRNA. Six antisense exon-exon junction sequences upstream of the trigger were recovered (four matching perfectly and two with single mismatches). These imply de novo copying of the mature mRNA template (16). The apparent scarcity of sel-1 siRNAs suggested that the procedure for cloning small RNAs (including ligation of linkers to 3' and 5' ends) might underrepresent the siRNA population (12). To analyze small RNA termini in detail, we used a number of structure-specific treatments. Treatment of RNA with periodate followed by elimination results in a shift on a denaturing acrylamide gel, indicating at least one unmodified (cis-diol) 3' terminus (17). Ribonuclease T (RNaseT) requires a 3'-hydroxyl to degrade single-stranded RNA. Finally, Terminator exonuclease preferentially degrades substrates with a single 5'-phosphate. Although sel-1 siRNAs are susceptible to both elimination and RNaseT reactions, they are resistant to Terminator (Fig. 2A). Control synthetic 25-nt sel-1 RNA oligonucleotides s with 5'-monophosphate and 3'-OH were sensitive to all three treatments. We surmised that sel-1 siRNAs are blocked at their 5' ends.

(A) sel-1 small RNAs are protected from 5'-exonucleolytic attack but not from 3' attack. Small RNAs were extracted from wild-type animals undergoing RNAi for sel-1; treated with the 5'-exonuclease Terminator, the 3'-exonuclease RNaseT, or sodium periodate plus elimination; and subjected to Northern analysis (20% 19:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide gel) with probe directed against the sel-1 trigger sequence (nt 535 to 992) (blue arrowheads). A control 25-nt synthetic sel-1 RNA (5'-monophosphate) was added to each reaction (red arrowhead). (B) Size distributions of various classes of cloned small RNAs with perfect matches to sel-1 sequence. We next asked if we could design a cloning protocol that would not be biased by the structure at the 5' end on an siRNA. The resulting protocol (fig. S3) avoids both (i) the requirement for ligation of the 5' end of the RNA and (ii) the possibility that modified 5' ends on small RNAs could affect enzymatic treatments of the paired cDNA strand. We detected 127 sel-1 antisense sequences and zero sense sequences from 1612 total clones using this protocol (Fig. 1C). For sel-1 antisense sequences, this represents a 40-fold enrichment compared to the 5'-ligation-dependent cloning method, providing further evidence for a prominent population of 5'-blocked siRNAs. Secondary siRNAs are still recovered in 5'-ligation-dependent cloning, albeit inefficiently, as indicated by the representation of sequences outside the trigger (presumably most siRNAs within the trigger are also secondary). Notably, we found that small antisense segments cloned with a 5'-ligation-independent procedure were on average 1 nt longer than those cloned with a 5'-ligation-dependent procedure (Fig. 2B; figs. S4 and S5). The substantial increase in incidence of sel-1 clones that followed 5'-ligation-independent cloning indicates that the vast majority of small sel-1 RNAs are modified on their 5' ends, while at most 2 to 3% (SOM Text) have simple 5'-phosphate termini that are exposed in vivo or produced by 5' cleavage during the cloning procedure. An assumption that sense and antisense are roughly equal in the primary siRNA pool leads to primary siRNA estimates of <0.6% of the total sel-1 siRNA population and <0.05% of the total 21- to 25-nt RNAs in the animal. The two methods of cloning were selective for different classes of endogenous small RNAs (table S1) (18, 19). microRNAs (miRNAs) appeared much less frequently with the 5'-ligation-independent cloning method, seemingly replaced by endogenous small RNAs corresponding to antisense sequence from coding regions. This analysis suggests that miRNAs and small antisense RNAs could be comparably abundant in C. elegans, with 5' modification of the small antisense RNAs accounting for the predominance of miRNA clones in libraries derived using ligation-dependent schemes. We observed 612 out of 245,420 clones from the 5'-ligation-dependent method and 9 out of 1612 clones from the 5'-ligation-independent method that were perfect antisense copies of exon/exon junctions, suggesting synthesis by RdRP acting on an mRNA template (fig. S6). To further characterize the modification of siRNAs in C. elegans, we used a ligation assay and Terminator 5'-exonuclease treatment (both requiring a 5'-phosphate). Sensitivity of the predominant fraction of the siRNAs could be restored by sequential treatment with alkaline phosphatase (which removes any number of 5'-phosphates) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (which adds a single 5'-phosphate), suggesting that the 5' modification was likely to involve additional 5'-phosphate groups on the siRNA (Fig. 3, A and B). How many phosphates do these molecules have on their 5' ends? Examining relative gel mobilities of the native and dephosphorylated siRNAs, using a variety of gel porosities (and using a series of synthetic RNA markers with different numbers of phosphates), indicated that the predominant fraction of the untreated siRNAs have triphosphate 5' termini (Fig. 3, C and D).

(A) Ligation assay shows that sel-1 small RNAs possess multiple 5'-phosphates. Samples were sequentially treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP), T4 polynucleotide kinase (T4 PNK), and/or ligase and analyzed by Northern blotting. Efficient ligation [leading to disappearance of the major siRNA bands (27)] requires 3'-OH/5'-monophosphate termini and was only observed after sequential treatment of siRNA populations with CIP (removing any number of 5'-phosphates) and T4 PNK (restoring a single 5'-phosphate). (B) Sensitivity to Terminator exonuclease, which preferentially degrades RNA with 5'-monophosphate termini. A 25-nt synthetic sel-1 control RNA with 5'-OH terminus was included as an internal control (red arrowhead). Gels (A) and (B) used a 19:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide composition under which phosphatase-treated siRNAs comigrate with untreated siRNAs. These species are resolved on 75:1 acrylamide:bis gels (C), where untreated species migrate more quickly than 5'-OH RNAs. (D) sel-1 small RNAs possess 5'-triphosphate termini. Control in vitro-synthesized RNAs with 5'-OH (lanes 1 and 6), 5'-monophosphate (lane 2), 5'-diphosphate (lane 3), 5'-triphosphate (lane 4), and 5'-tetraphosphate (lane 5) termini serve as mobility standards (blue arrowheads). With a high bis-acrylamide ratio (9:1 acrylamide:bis 12%), the size contribution of each 5'-terminal phosphate confers a prominent change in mobility such that a "ladder" of differentially 5'-phosphorylated species is observed. In vivo sel-1 siRNAs were treated with CIP (lane 7) or mock-treated (lane 8) with a darker exposure of these lanes in the right panel (red arrowheads). The distance migrated through the gel relative to the 5'-OH-terminated species (lanes 2 to 6 were compared to lane 1 and lane 8 was compared to lane 7), given by the numbers in arbitrary units below each lane, demonstrated that in vivo siRNAs migrate as 5'-triphosphate-terminated RNAs. The results presented here define an RNA population produced de novo during RNAi in C. elegans as a pool of 5'-triphosphate-terminated small antisense molecules templated by the mature mRNA target and covering sequences both upstream and downstream of the original dsRNA trigger. On the basis of this work and previous literature, our current working model for amplified gene silencing in C. elegans is that rare primary siRNAs, formed from a long dsRNA trigger, act as guides (presumably in an Argonaute-dependent manner) to recruit RdRP to targeted transcripts. This recruitment leads to de novo synthesis of short antisense RNAs that must be stripped off the template mRNA and incorporated into complexes that are capable of finding additional silencing targets. This model differs from other examples of RdRP action, such as in the generation of ta-siRNAs in A. thaliana where repeated DICER activity on long RdRP-generated dsRNAs produces a phased distribution of small RNAs (20). Although ongoing RNAi is certainly important for de novo synthesis of antisense siRNAs, this process appears to contribute by providing guidance to the RdRP rather than priming activity. Primary silencing targets may or may not be degraded; whatever their fate, however, they remain intact for a sufficient period to be substrates for RdRP activity upstream and (somewhat less efficiently) downstream of the targeting site. This model is consistent with the biochemical properties of characterized cellular RdRPs in that these enzymes are capable of unprimed (as well as primed) synthesis (10, 11). Initiation at 3' ends of potential templates has been reported for fungal and plant RdRPs; this might allow initial Argonaute-mediated cleavage of mRNA targets to yield ready RdRP substrates. Previous investigations of siRNA structure revealing double-stranded character, 3' overhangs, and 5'-monophosphate termini were performed in organisms whose genomes do not encode canonical RdRPs (2, 21, 22). In addition, crystal structures of Argonaute proteins [key executioners in the RNAi pathway (23-25)] indicate considerable specificity in recognizing specific 5' structures in RNA. It is possible that 5'-triphosphate antisense RNAs are themselves inactive in gene silencing, requiring either removal of two terminal phosphates or of the entire first base for activity. Alternatively, triphosphate-terminated small RNAs may be active directly as silencing triggers, potentially through distinct members of the Argonaute family that might recognize guide RNAs with a 5'-triphosphate. One feature of the proposed mechanism is the involvement of dsRNA trigger only at the earliest stage of the process (production of primary siRNAs). Following this stage, the double-stranded character of the original trigger plays no role in the reaction. Given diverse structural features that could target an aberrant mRNA for RdRP activity, such a system would permit analogous machineries (each involving RdRP, helicase, and Argonaute activities) to serve in amplified surveillance processes triggered by both aberrant mRNA structure (3) and dsRNA (26).
Abstract In Caenorhabditis elegans, an effective RNA interference (RNAi) response requires the production of secondary short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by RNA-directed RNA polymerases (RdRPs). We cloned secondary siRNAs from transgenic C. elegans lines expressing a single 22-nucleotide primary siRNA. Several secondary siRNAs start a few nucleotides downstream of the primary siRNA, indicating that non-RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex)-cleaved mRNAs are substrates for secondary siRNA production. In lines expressing primary siRNAs with single-nucleotide mismatches, secondary siRNAs do not carry the mismatch but contain the nucleotide complementary to the mRNA. We infer that RdRPs perform unprimed RNA synthesis. Secondary siRNAs are only of antisense polarity, carry 5' di- or triphosphates, and are only in the minority associated with RDE-1, the RNAi-specific Argonaute protein. Therefore, secondary siRNAs represent a distinct class of small RNAs. Their biogenesis depends on RdRPs, and we propose that each secondary siRNA is an individual RdRP product. RNAi is triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules that are cleaved into 20- to 25-nucleotide (nt) siRNAs, which guide cleavage of homologous RNA molecules (1). Amplification of RNAi is inferred from the spreading of RNA silencing to regions outside the inducer sequence (transitive RNAi) (2-4) and involves the production of secondary siRNAs for which RdRPs have been implicated in nematodes, plants, and fungi (5). In vitro, RdRPs can perform both primed and unprimed RNA synthesis (6, 7). In plants, the predominant route appears to be unprimed (5' to 3') RNA synthesis starting at the 3' end of targeted transcripts and secondary siRNA production by DICER cleavages (4, 8). Endogenous secondary siRNAs (trans-acting siRNAs, produced after miRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage) occur in a 21-nt register and correspond to both the sense and the antisense strand (9-12). Secondary siRNAs in C. elegans differ from those in plants in two aspects: The secondary siRNAs are only found upstream of the initial dsRNA trigger (3, 13), and they are only of antisense polarity (14, 3). Whereas trigger-derived primary siRNAs are bound by RDE-1, the secondary siRNAs are bound by a different set of Argonaute proteins (15). It is unknown how secondary siRNA production in C. elegans proceeds-whether RdRP-dependent cRNA synthesis starts primed on a primary siRNA or unprimed at the primary target site. Although the size of these secondary siRNAs (20 to 25 nt) (3) suggests that they are DICER products, their single polarity is difficult to explain. To obtain a single and well-defined entry point of transitive RNAi, we constitutively expressed a single 22-nt primary siRNA against the unc-22 body wall muscle gene from a miRNA-like transgene (fig. S1A). Worms transgenic for this 22si-gene show a twitching phenotype indicative of unc-22 silencing, and unc-22 mRNA expression is reduced by 50% (fig. S1B). Transitive RNAi in 22si lines has the characteristic C. elegans pattern, because secondary siRNAs occur only upstream of the primary target site and are only of antisense polarity (Fig. 1A). The 22si twitching phenotype is dependent on rde (RNAi-deficient) genes, such as rde-1, and not on miRNA-implicated genes, such as alg-1 or alg-2 (Table 1). Apparently, the 22siRNA functions as an siRNA, even though it is processed from a primary miRNA-like transcript (fig. S1A), and accordingly (16), 22siRNA-mediated RNAi depends on matching of nucleotides 10, 11, and 12 to the target (fig. S1, A and C to E). Secondary siRNAs are absent in mutant backgrounds that result in nonphenotypic nematodes (Table 1), confirming that RNAi amplification is required for a 22si twitching phenotype. The primary 22siRNA was detected in all mutant backgrounds tested (Table 1), including rde-1 and rde-4 that were previously shown to be deficient in producing primary siRNAs (17, 18). Size fractionation experiments revealed that in a wild-type (WT) background, the 22siRNA occurs in a complex of 100 to 150 kD that represents 22siRNA bound to RDE-1 (Fig. 1B), which is presumably the active silencing complex. miRNA complexes are larger (250 to 500 kD) (Fig. 1B) (19). In rde-1 and rde-4 mutants, the 22siRNA occurs in a 500-to 550-kD complex and cofractionates with DCR-1 (Fig. 1B). The passenger strand (the strand of an siRNA-duplex not incorporated into RISC), which is below detection in a WT background, accumulates in rde-1 and rde-4 mutants and cofractionates with the guide strand (the RISC-incorporated siRNA strand) (Fig. 1B). We infer that, in the absence of RDE-1 or RDE-4, the 22siRNA duplex remains in the DICER complex and the active silencing complex fails to be generated.

To determine the repertoire of secondary siRNAs generated during 22siRNA silencing, we cloned small RNAs by using a linker-independent protocol and sequence-selected secondary siRNAs by using biotinylated unc-22-specific oligonucleotides. Two different biotin oligonucleotides were used; oligo 1, which selects for secondary siRNAs in the 75-nt region immediately upstream of the primary siRNA (Fig. 2A); and oligo 2, which selects for primary and secondary siRNAs in a 50-nt region around the 22si target site (Fig. 2B). Consistent with ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) analyses (Fig. 1A), the cloned secondary siRNAs are of antisense polarity only and have a predominant length of 21 to 22 nt (table S1). Their production starts a few nucleotides downstream of the primary siRNA target site (Fig. 2B; table S2, column 1), which shows that non-RISC-cleaved mRNAs are among the substrates for secondary siRNA production. Because no further downstream secondary siRNAs are detected in RPA analyses (using 500-nt probes) (Fig. 1A), we infer that RdRP recruitment is restricted to the region around the primary siRNA. The generation of secondary siRNAs is a regulated process because similar sets of secondary siRNAs were cloned (Fig. 2A; table S1) in independent 22si worm lines and cloning experiments. RNA gel blots detecting secondary siRNAs showed that most of the 22si signal is RdRP-independent and represents primary siRNAs (fig. S2A). The secondary siRNAs appear to be in a phased register, suggesting that secondary siRNA production occurs via consecutive steps: either by progressive cleavages on a cRNA (by, e.g., DICER) or by multiple rounds of amplification (secondary siRNAs invoking tertiary siRNA production).

(E) RNA gel blot analysis of capping assay. DICER products have 5'-monophosphates and 2',3'-hydroxy termini. miR-58 and 22si (which are both cleaved by DICER from an miRNA precursor) and the secondary siRNAs carry terminal 2',3'-hydroxyl groups, because NaIO4-reacted, -eliminated RNAs (20) migrate 1/21 nt faster than the untreated RNAs (Fig. 2C and fig. S2B). Like miR-58 and 22siRNA, the secondary siRNAs contain 5'-phosphates, because alkaline phosphatase-treated RNAs migrate about half a nucleotide slower than untreated RNAs (Fig. 2C and fig. S2B). In contrast to miR-58 and 22si molecules, untreated secondary siRNAs migrate somewhat slower than their 5'-monophosphorylated derivatives (Fig. 2C and fig. S2B), suggesting that secondary siRNAs carry a different number of 5'-phosphates. Absence of a 5'-monophosphate was also inferred from ligation experiments with T4 RNA ligase, which requires a 5'-monophosphate; the 5' linker successfully ligated to miR-58 and 22siRNA but failed to ligate to secondary siRNAs (Fig. 2D). Secondary siRNAs have 5' di- or triphosphate because they can be capped with vaccinia virus capping enzyme, as deduced from a 2-nt slower migration (Fig. 2E). A minority of 22siRNAs can be capped and represent secondary siRNAs of the same sequence as the primary siRNA (Fig. 2E). From these findings we infer that it is unlikely that secondary siRNAs in C. elegans are products of consecutive DICER cleavages, although we cannot exclude that they are modified after dicing. Alternatively, they either are 21- or 22-nt cRNAs (short RdRP products), or they are cleaved from longer cRNAs by an alternative nuclease or by an alternative way of dicing. Several alternatives exist for initiation of secondary siRNA production: (i) cRNA synthesis occurs primed on 22siRNA molecules; (ii) cRNA synthesis starts unprimed at 22si-RISC-cleaved mRNA; and (iii) RdRPs are recruited to an mRNA targeted by a 22siRNA, and unprimed cRNA synthesis occurs by internal entry around the target site. Occurrence of this third route is supported by the finding that secondary siRNA production occurs a few nucleotides downstream of the primary siRNA. To investigate whether cRNA is generated by elongation of the primary siRNA, we generated two new transgenic lines in which the 22siRNA carries a single mismatch to the unc-22 target mRNA at position 21 or position 11. Replacement of the mismatches within the secondary siRNAs would show unprimed cRNA synthesis, whereas primed synthesis would result in maintenance of the mismatched nucleotide in the secondary siRNA. Both 22si-mm21 and 22si-mm11 transgenic nematodes show a weak twitching phenotype indicative of unc-22 silencing and produce relatively low levels of secondary siRNAs (Fig. 3A), possibly due to the presence of a single-nucleotide mismatch. Sequence analysis of secondary siRNAs that have overlap with the primary siRNA showed that for all these secondary siRNAs, both mm21 and mm11 had been replaced by the nucleotide complementary to the mRNA (Fig. 3, B and C; table S2). Thus, secondary siRNA production occurs only unprimed. The 22siRNA is bound by RDE-1 (Fig. 1B and fig. S3A), which carries the DDH motif needed for RISC cleavage (21). The presence of a mismatch at the presumed RISC cleavage site in the 22si-mm11 primary siRNA did not alter the range of secondary siRNAs that were cloned (Fig. 3C, table S2), suggesting that nematode RNAi does not primarily depend on RISC cleavage of mRNAs. A minority of the secondary siRNAs is loaded into the RNAi-specific argonaute protein RDE-1 (fig. S3, A and B), and most secondary siRNAs may be loaded into secondary Argonaute proteins (15) (fig. S3C). The phased register in which the secondary siRNAs appear to be ordered (Fig. 2A) may arise from multiple amplification rounds (by RDE-1-loaded secondary siRNAs) or from preferred initiation sites of cRNA synthesis.

Secondary siRNAs represent a distinct class of 21- to 22-nt small RNAs that can can silence mRNAs in trans (3). They result from unprimed RNA synthesis (Fig. 3, B and C), are only of antisense polarity (Fig. 1A), carry 5' di- or triphosphates (Fig. 2, C to E), and are mainly loaded into a distinct set of Argonaute proteins (15) (fig. S3). Secondary siRNAs can be produced on non-RISC-cleaved mRNAs presumably by internal entry of the RdRP. A 3' nonprogressive DICER cleavage may be responsible for generating the secondary siRNA 3' end and degrading the mRNA (fig. S4). We find that for the 22siRNA, a single-nucleotide mismatch decreases silencing efficiency considerably. Likely, these strict prerequisites for inducing transitive RNAi protect organisms against unintended off-target effects (22, 23).
Abstract In principle, a complex assembly of strongly interacting electrons can self-organize into a wide variety of collective states, but relatively few such states have been identified in practice. We report that, in the close vicinity of a metamagnetic quantum critical point, high-purity strontium ruthenate Sr3Ru2O7 possesses a large magnetoresistive anisotropy, consistent with the existence of an electronic nematic fluid. We discuss a striking phenomenological similarity between our observations and those made in high-purity two-dimensional electron fluids in gallium arsenide devices. In the standard materials that form the basis of most of today's electronic technology, the Hamiltonian for the outer electrons is dominated by the attraction to the ions of the crystalline lattice. In "strongly correlated" materials, this is no longer true. The Coulomb interaction between electrons is large, so it might be expected to add a large term to the Hamiltonian that is not necessarily strongly related to the periodic potential. However, in most correlated electron systems studied to date, the many-electron collective states still retain strong links with the lattice, and the range of "correlated electron matter" identified so far is considerably less diverse than should, in principle, be possible. In itinerant systems, it almost always consists of electron liquids such as Fermi liquids or superfluids that respect the lattice symmetry; the identification of super-conductors in which the condensate breaks some lattice symmetries has been one of the triumphs of the field. [For a recent review, see (1).] In recent years, there have been proposals that even more exotic electronic liquids might be observable. In an analogy with the nematic state of liquid crystals, which is characterized by orientational but not positional order, it might be possible to form nematic liquids in electronic systems with strong correlations (2). In the broadest sense, a correlated electron nematic is characterized by a lowering of rotational symmetry in its itinerant properties that is not simply a consequence of a symmetry lowering of the lattice. We report electrical transport phenomena that show that the correlated electron system possesses this key property of a nematic fluid. In previous work, we have argued that a novel quantum phase forms in the vicinity of a metamagnetic quantum critical point in the correlated electron oxide Sr3Ru2O7 (3-5). Here, we show that this state is accompanied by pronounced magnetoresistive anisotropies that have two-fold symmetry and can be aligned using modest in-plane magnetic fields. Even in the presence of these two-fold anisotropies, neutron single-crystal diffraction resolves no change from the initial square symmetry of the lattice. The overall phenomenology of our observations bears a striking resemblance to that observed in gallium arsenide (GaAs) devices near the high-field limit (6-9), which suggests that the nematic phenomena previously thought to be specific to close proximity to a fractional quantum Hall state may be more general. The single crystals used in the present work were grown in an image furnace with techniques described fully in (10). All transport data shown are measurements of the in-plane magnetoresistivity, denoted (11). Crystal purity is crucial in Sr3Ru2O7. For a residual resistivity o 3 1/2 copyright cm (corresponding to a mean free path of 1/2300 A or less), the phase diagram contains a quantum critical point (QCP) that can be accessed by the application of a magnetic field of 1/27.8 T parallel to the crystalline c axis and the effects of which have now been studied with a variety of experimental probes (12-17). As the purity is increased, first-order phase transitions appear as the QCP is approached, and measurements of at least five thermodynamic and transport properties contain features whose loci enclose a well-defined region of the phase diagram in the vicinity of the QCP. Previously, we have argued that these observations are indicative of the formation of a new quantum phase (3-5). For fields applied parallel to c, has a pronounced anomaly when this phase is entered (Fig. 1A). The two steep "sidewalls" coincide with first-order phase transitions that can be observed using ac susceptibility or magnetization. The angle, , of the applied magnetic field to the ab plane of the crystal is a known tuning parameter in Sr3Ru2O7 (14). Previous work has shown that the large resistive anomaly of Fig. 1A disappears rapidly with tilt angle (18), leaving behind much weaker signals in that trace the origin of the two first-order phase transitions as a bifurcation from a single first-order transition at 60 (5), marked by the white arrow in Fig. 2A. At first sight, this seems to contradict the identification of the bounded region between the two first-order lines as a single distinctive phase; there was no evidence that the sudden drop in resistivity with the angle at 80 coincided with any phase boundary. The apparent contradiction can be resolved by postulating the existence of domains of some kind. In such a picture, the behavior shown in Figs. 1A and 2A would be due to these domains producing the extra scattering. The fact that the anomalous scattering disappears so rapidly as increases would then be most straightforwardly interpreted as being due to the in-plane component of the tilted magnetic field (Hin-plane) destroying the domains.

(B) With the crystal tilted such that the field is 13 from c, giving an in-plane component along a, a pronounced anisotropy is seen, with the easy direction for current flow being along b, perpendicular to the in-plane field component (18). If the in-plane field component is aligned along b instead, the easy direction switches to current flow along a. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2. Three-dimensional plots of the magnetoresistivity components bb (A) and aa (B) of a single crystal of Sr3Ru2O7 as the external magnetic field is rotated from alignment along the crystalline a axis (0) to alignment along the crystalline c axis (90), at a constant temperature of 100 mK. The quantity Hc() that normalizes h is the main metamagnetic transition (i.e., the one that dominates the change in the magnetic moment). It varies smoothly from 5.1 T at 0 to 7.87 T at 90. The same data plotted without this normalization are shown in SOM Text 3. However, instead of simply removing the anomalous peak, Hin-plane exposed an intrinsic asymmetry of the underlying phase, defining "easy" and "hard" directions for magnetotransport. These easy and hard directions are shown in Fig. 1B. In previous experiments (3-5), we had worked with the current I // b Hin-plane, so that the standard metallic transverse magnetoresistance bb could be studied across the whole phase diagram. In that configuration (red traces in Fig. 1), the anomalous scattering disappears rapidly as Hin-plane increases. However, the behavior of aa (measured with I // a // Hin-plane) is completely different. As shown by the black traces in Fig. 1, the scattering rate remains high even for an angle at which the anomalous scattering is absent for I Hin-plane. Pronounced in-plane resistive anisotropy can have a number of origins. There is known to be a strong magnetostructural coupling in Sr3Ru2O7, so one possibility is a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition giving the resistive anisotropy due to a corresponding anisotropy in the hopping integrals. Another is the formation of field-alignable magnetic domains such as those examined in the context of itinerant metamagnetism in recent theoretical work (19, 20). To investigate these possibilities, we first carried out measurements of (H) and magnetic susceptibility (H) at temperatures between 20 mK and 4 K on 20 samples from three different batches with a wide variety of shapes, 6 of which were cut from the same piece of crystal (SOM Text 3). Shapes vary from square plates with sides A B >> C to rectangular plates with side A >> B >> C to long cylinders with A B 1/280 mT), all the first-order phase boundaries observed in Sr3Ru2O7 were invariant under changes to the sample shape. This firmly rules out demagnetization effects as playing a major role in determining the physics and, hence, directly contradicts predictions concerning magnetic domains (20). To check for a large spontaneous lattice parameter anisotropy, we performed elastic neutron scattering measurements for H // c (SOM Text 2). Within our experimental resolution of 4 * 10-5 A, we see no evidence of any difference in lattice parameters a and b in the anomalous region. The experiments described above therefore rule out two of the more standard explanations (magnetic domains and structural change) for the anisotropy shown in Fig. 1B. In Fig. 2, we show the complete magnetoresistive field-angle "phase diagrams" for fields between 4.2 T and 9 T rotating the entire 90 from parallel to a to parallel to c ( = 90). The temperature is 100 mK. Figure 2A shows the magnetoresistivity for the easy direction, bb, and Fig. 2B that for the hard direction, aa. Figure 3 shows typical data for the difference in between the hard and easy directions (main figure) and the temperature dependence of in a field of 7.4 T along both directions (upper inset). Along the easy direction, standard metallic behavior is seen, whereas a nonmetallic temperature dependence is seen for the hard direction [in agreement with results reported previously (3, 4)]. In the presence of such temperature-dependent anisotropy, it is reasonable to plot the difference between aa and bb, normalized by their sum, as a phenomenological order parameter. This is done in the lower inset to Fig. 3 at a field applied at =72. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

(Upper inset) The temperature dependence of aa (black) and bb (red) for 1/2oH = 7.4 T applied in the direction specified above. For this field orientation, bb has a clearly metallic temperature dependence, whereas aa has the mildly nonmetallic temperature dependence previously reported for H // c in (3, 4). If the in-plane field component is instead oriented along b, bb and bb switch in both magnitude and temperature dependence. (Lower inset) The temperature dependence of the difference between the two magnetoresistivities shown in the upper inset, normalized by their sum, which is similar to that expected for the order parameter associated with a continuous thermal phase transition. Several striking features are evident from our data: (i) A key finding is that strong scattering can be observed in the whole region of the phase diagram enclosed by the two first-order phase boundaries that bifurcate from a single first-order transition line at 60 (5). If there is an in-plane field component, this scattering becomes strongly anisotropic. The present observations are important because if one interprets the lower inset of Fig. 3 as evidence for an order parameter, one sees that the phase that it describes is bounded (at low temperatures and constant ) by well-defined first-order phase transitions that are independent of extrinsic parameters such as sample shape. (ii) Although the easy direction in Fig. 2 is for currents passed along the b axis, this is determined by the in-plane field component having been directed along a for the data shown. If the direction of the field is rotated by 90, the anisotropy is reversed and a becomes the easy direction. Checks show that the rotation is not smooth; the easy direction is either along a or b but cannot be made to lie, for example, at 45. (iii) As can be seen in the lower inset to Fig. 3, the presence of a (small) symmetry-breaking Hin-plane slightly rounds off the transition in temperature, giving a "tail" above 800 mK. This effect, which highlights the fact that an in-plane field (that breaks rotational symmetry) is conjugate to the order parameter, becomes more pronounced for lower angles, that is, for higher Hin-plane. (iv) Another feature, weaker, broader, but still very noticeable, is seen in the hard direction for and h 1.2 (Fig. 2B). (v) The anisotropy described in point (iv) is, like the one described in point (i), extremely sensitive to sample purity [(21) and SOM Text 4], strongly suggesting a common origin for the two. Its breadth in field and in temperature (not shown) is also consistent with its proximity to the ab plane, that is, in the presence of a large in-plane magnetic field. Specific heat data taken cooling down at its central field (h 1.2) show a logarithmic divergence of C/T down to 1 K (21), giving good evidence that this feature, like that for fields parallel to c, is related to incipient quantum criticality. The combination of susceptibility, neutron scattering, and transport data gives strong evidence for the spontaneous formation of a structured, anisotropic state in the correlated electron fluid as a quantum critical point is approached in Sr3Ru2O7. Although the anisotropy is seen explicitly in the presence of a weak symmetry-breaking in-plane field component, there is compelling evidence that the symmetry breaking of the correlated electron state is spontaneous and exists even for H // c. The data shown in Fig. 1A can be reconciled with those at other parts of the phase diagram (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2) if the hard axis is randomly oriented along the a and b directions in different regions of the sample, leading to overall isotropy despite strong local anisotropy. Such behavior is commonplace in symmetry-broken states, for example, in simple ferromagnets in zero applied magnetic field (22). Interesting comparisons can be made between the present data and those in other correlated systems. In-plane transport anisotropies have been observed in both cuprates and manganites. In those systems, the crystals are always orthorhombic, but in some cases the anisotropy increases while the degree of orthorhombicity decreases, and strong anomalies have been seen in the Hall effect, both of which have been interpreted as evidence for spontaneous charge-stripe formation (23-25). A much stronger similarity exists between our observations and those on two-dimensional (2D) GaAs devices. For example, it was shown (6-9) that if the devices can be prepared with ultrahigh mobility such that the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) could be observed in the upper two Landau levels, the correlated electron system does not make a simple FQHE-Fermi liquid crossover as the field is reduced and the filling is increased. In the N =2 to N = 5 Landau levels, the FQHE is replaced by a strong spontaneous resistive anisotropy aligned with principal in-plane crystal axes, even though the crystal symmetry shows no evidence of orthorhombicity. The anisotropy exists even for fields perpendicular to the plane of the device (presumably because of some symmetry-breaking gradients introduced during device fabrication) but can be rotated by 90 by applying a modest inplane field. Just as in the present observations on Sr3Ru2O7, the GaAs data have strong temperature and purity dependencies, and the easy direction lies perpendicular to an in-plane field applied along one of the two relevant crystalline principal axes. The phenomenological similarity between the GaAs and Sr3Ru2O7 results suggests a common origin for the observations. The disorder dependence gives an important clue, because strong sensitivity to elastic scattering is the signature of a state that is anisotropic in k-space, as is well known in unconventional superconductivity (26). The challenge is how to reconcile what are, apparently, large differences in the starting physical situations. To promote self-organization of a correlated electron system, one must tune the ratio of a potential energy term often summarized by the parameter U (the Coulomb repulsion, which tends to localize) to the kinetic energy, often denoted by W, which tends to delocalize. If this is done "chemically," by forming new compounds, the change in the U/W ratioisstrongly linked to a change to the electron-lattice coupling, because increasing U and decreasing W also involves increasing the strength of the periodic potential. In the GaAs devices, it is possible to increase the U/W ratio by quenching the kinetic energy by going to very low Landau levels. This leads to a relatively high effective correlation strength without an increase in the effective strength of the periodic potential. In Sr3Ru2O7, similar basic physics is taking place but with a different kind of tuning. It is intrinsically a strongly correlated material, so the starting periodic potential is much larger than in GaAs. However, the existence of an underlying metamagnetic quantum critical point makes the quasiparticle mass m* diverge on the approach to criticality (15, 27). This mass divergence is another route to increasing U/W without increasing the strength of the periodic potential, hence freeing the correlated electron fluid from its rigid link to the underlying lattice. We have shown that in highly restricted parts of its phase diagram, in proximity to metamagnetic quantum critical points, the electron fluid in Sr3Ru2O7 develops a strong resistive anisotropy, whose hard and easy axes can be interchanged by the application of modest in-plane magnetic fields. The data are consistent with the formation of a nematic state with broken rotational symmetry. Intriguingly, a correlated electron nematic arising from a Pomeranchuk-like Fermi surface distortion (4, 28-36) possesses two of the key features that are present in our data and those from GaAs, namely the k-space anisotropy that would give a strong disorder dependence and the possibility of anisotropic transport, intrinsic or through domain formation (37). Whatever the detailed microscopic origin (38), our data suggest that nematic behavior is a feature of ultraclean low-dimensional correlated electron systems in which the bandwidth can be reduced independently of changes to the strength of the periodic potential.
This article has a correction. Please see:Is corrected by - May 11, 2007 Abstract Environmental sequencing has revealed unimagined diversity among eukaryotic picoplankton. A distinct picoplanktonic algal group, initially detected from 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences, was hybridized with rRNA -targeted (rRNA-targeted) probes, detected by tyramide signal amplification-fluorescent in situ hybridization, and showed an organelle-like body with orange fluorescence indicative of phycobilins. Using this fluorescence signal, cells were sorted by flow cytometry and probed. Hybridized cells contained a 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained organelle resembling a plastid with a nucleomorph. This suggests that they may be secondary endosymbiotic algae. Pending the isolation of living cells and their formal description, these algae have been termed picobiliphytes. Molecular tools applied to DNA retrieved from marine microorganisms have revealed considerable diversity among the smallest eukaryotic cells (1-3), paralleling that found among marine prokaryotes. Together with a high taxonomic diversity, the finding of many sequences unrelated to those of known organisms was an additional striking feature of these first studies. Clone libraries for the eukaryotic 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene were constructed at different times from fractionated water samples (using a filter pore size of 3 1/2m) from three coastal sites (4-6), and additional libraries were established from three more open-water sites (7, 8) (table S2). A particular group of sequences was recovered irregularly throughout the year (8)(table S2) and referred to as the "Rosko II" group from partial 18S sequence phylogenies from these sites (4-6). Analyses of full-length sequences (8) reveal that they form an independent phylogenetic group among major eukaryotic taxa (Fig. 1), (9, 10), which we have tentatively called picobiliphytes. Our complex iterative Bayesian analyses (8) indicate that the picobiliphytes are an independent lineage, possibly having a weak sister relationship with the cryptophyte/katabletablepharid clade, although its true sister group is difficult to assign using a single gene phylogeny. The inability to assign an affinity of the picobiliphytes to any other major eukaryotic group (table S1) in the eukaryotic 18S rDNA tree was confirmed with the Kashino-Hasagawa test (8) (table S3). Their deep branching suggests that they probably deserve a taxonomic rank of division or phylum. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed from full-length 18S rRNA sequence data listed in table S1 and inferred with Bayesian analysis from two parallel runs, each with one million generations with six chains and increased temperature between the chains to facilitate exchange between the chains (8). This tree is the 50% majority-rule tree of the last 100 trees saved from one of the parallel runs. Support for each node was also determined with 100 replicated bootstrap analyses of weighted maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining analyses. Nodes supported by bootstrap or posterior probability values above 50% are labeled for the three methods used (MrBayes/maximum parsimony/neighbor-joining). If a clade was not supported by a method, it is indicated by a dash. The asterisk indicates that internal major clades were supported by 100 posterior probabilities from the MrBayes analysis. PICOBI01 and PICOBI02 are specific for the sequences belonging to the three clades as bracketed. (Insert) Picture of a cell targeted by the probe PICOBI02 (specific for picobiliphyte clade 2) from the Roscoff ASTAN sampling site on 26 September 2001. Arrows point to the DAPI-stained nucleus (nuc) in blue, to the green fluorescence from probe-specific labeling of the small subunit rRNA in the cytoplasm (cyto), and to the red autofluorescence from the phycobiliprotein-containing organelle (PBPorg). Double asterisks indicate sequences not recognized by the probes. Picobiliphytes consist of at least three different clades (Fig. 1), for which we were able to identify two signature sequences: PICOBI01 (5'-GCGTGATGCCAAAATCCG-3') and PICOBI02 (5'-ATATGCCCGTCAAACCGT-3'), which target most picobiliphytes (tables S4 and S5). They have two or more mismatches with all available GenBank sequences from cultivated protists (tables S4 and S5) and do not display any fluorescence when hybridized to a variety of algal strains from the Roscoff Culture Collection (8, 11) (table S6). In addition, they match a set of five additional environmental 18S rDNA partial sequences: four from the western North Atlantic (12) and one from a mid-Atlantic estuary (Barnegat Bay, New Jersey), extending the possible distribution of the picobiliphytes. These probes enabled us to determine, by microscopy after tyramide signal amplification-fluorescent in situ hybridization (TSA-FISH) (13), the gross morphology of fixed cells from the Roscoff coastal site (Fig. 1 and fig. S1). The morphology of other unknown marine protist groups was also determined by Massana et al. (14), using probe methods. Picobiliphytes are unicellular, slightly oblong, and approximately 2 * 6 1/2m (n = 9 cells) and were recovered in the picoplankton size fraction of our water samples because they probably passed though the 3-1/2m pores in the filter by way of their smallest dimension. Thus, we have referred to them as picoplankton. One remarkable feature is the presence of an organelle-like structure having orange autofluorescence when excited with blue light under epifluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1), a structure similar to that of phycobiliprotein-containing rhodophytes and cryptomonads (fig. S1). These pigments, in contrast to chlorophylls, are water-soluble (15) and thus not removed by the TSA-FISH alcohol dehydration steps. Moreover, any chlorophyll remaining after alcohol dehydration fluoresces yellow, not orange, under blue light (fig. S1). Thus, picobiliphytes probably have a phycobiliprotein-containing organelle, most probably a plastid. Another distinctive feature is a small body that is stainable with the nucleic acid-specific dye DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), distinct from the main nucleus and consistently seen in close proximity to the presumed plastid (Fig. 1, fig. S1). Picobiliphyte sequences have been found in a variety of marine systems, including the European coast (8), the North Atlantic (from GenBank Blast searches), and the Arctic Ocean (7). A detailed look at their abundance, applying TSA-FISH in size-fractionated (1/2m) seawater samples from the English Channel, revealed that picobiliphytes occurred mostly in fall and winter and were not detected by FISH in summer, although their sequences were occasionally detected in summer clone libraries (tables S2 and S8). Their concentration, up to 80 cells ml-1, accounted for about 1.6% of the total picoeukaryote cell counts at one coastal station in the English Channel and corresponded to a major proportion (33 to 81%) of orange-fluorescing picoeukaryotic cells detected by blue laser flow cytometry (tables S7 and S8). In one particular sample, cells exhibiting this fluorescence were sorted by flow cytometry and subsequently hybridized by TSA-FISH with our two probes (8) (table S7). We found that 48 to 61% of the sorted cells were labeled with probes PICOBI01 and PICOBI02, suggesting that the picobiliphytes may constitute a substantial proportion of the orange-fluorescing eukaryotic picoplankton previously thought to be cryptophytes (16). The fact that our cells could have been sorted and enriched with a phycobilin pigment signature detected with flow cytometry further supports the contention that they actually possess such pigments (15, 16). The inferred presence of a phycobiliprotein-containing plastid in picobiliphytes is in good agreement with their putative sister relationship to cryptophytes and katablepharids, the first of which contain phycobiliproteins. Whereas cryptophytes are common in the marine nanophyto-plankton, pico-sized cryptophytes are not as abundant, as judged by their relative frequency in clone libraries; and where found, their 18S rDNA sequence places them as an independent lineage within the nano-sized cryptomonads (5, 6). There are also small cell forms among the red algae, such as the marine Porphyridiales, but our group does not belong to the rhodophytes, based on our phylogenetic analysis. Cryptophytes are a well-known example of a secondary endosymbiosis of a rhodophyte, which brings phycobilin pigments to the new host cell. Because picobiliphytes are sister to the cryptophyte/katabletablepharid clade in most of our complex Bayesian analyses (8) (Fig. 1), it would be most parsimonious to assume that our group is a secondary endosymbiotic alga. The small body stainable with the nucleic acid-specific dye DAPI (Fig. 1) may be a DNA-containing nucleomorph, similar to that found in cryptophytes and chlorarachniophytes (17), supporting the idea that picobiliphytes are another secondary endosymbiotic algal group (18). Kleptoplastidy is another possibility, such as in the katablepharids (19, 20), which along with the cryptophytes are the picobiliphytes' purported sister group. However, kleptoplastidy is unlikely in such small organisms. In the absence of living cells to follow through cell division, we screened filtered 3-1/2m-fractioned water for cells that hybridized with our probes, using a ChemScan solid-phase cytometer (8) (fig. S2). We never encountered positive cells without a plastid on the filters scanned by the laser, which implies that the cells are predominately pigmented, so kleptoplastidy does not seem very likely. Are the picobiliphytes representatives of another red algal secondary endosymbiosis, such as chromo-alveolates, in the broad sense, or do they have kleptoplastids? Without living cells, the status of their endosymbiosis and a formal description will remain unresolved. Nevertheless, picobiliphytes are pigmented and thus contribute to primary production. Molecular analysis confirms that they are a eukaryotic group that should be recognized at the phylum or division level, without any real indication of their sister group. We found that they are well represented in polar and cold temperate coastal marine ecosystems, as judged from their appearance in clone libraries and preliminary FISH data. The putative presence of a DNA-containing body in the purported plastid places them in an intriguing position in the study of plastid reduction to organelles. Within the past 15 years, four algal classes have been described from the picoplankton [see (5) for details], and picobiliphytes represent another division or phylum. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that they are a highly diverse group, composed of at least three distinct clades. The temporal and spatial scales at which they occur, as inferred from molecular data, indicate that they could make up a substantial picoplankton fraction under certain conditions. The existence of small, sometimes rare, organisms is only now being recognized, and their role in ecosystem function is unknown, but they probably act as reservoirs of genetic capacity that are activated under specific conditions. The discovery of picobiliphytes and their apparent widespread distribution and contribution to marine protist assemblages highlight the imperative of understanding biodiversity before its loss on a global scale.
Abstract The bacterial endosymbiont of the deep-sea tube worm Riftia pachyptila has never been successfully cultivated outside its host. In the absence of cultivation data, we have taken a proteomic approach based on the metagenome sequence to study the metabolism of this peculiar microorganism in detail. As one result, we found that three major sulfide oxidation proteins constitute 1/212% of the total cytosolic proteome, which highlights the essential role of these enzymes for the symbiont's energy metabolism. Unexpectedly, the symbiont uses the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle in addition to the previously identified Calvin cycle for CO2 fixation. Riftia pachyptila inhabits deep-sea hydrothermal vent areas along mid-ocean ridges in the East Pacific (1). Instead of containing a digestive system, the worm'scoelomic cavity is densely populated by a single species of sulfide-oxidizing gamma-proteobacteria that provide for their host's carbon and energy supply by fixing CO2 from the surrounding water (2-4). Microbial chemosynthesis is sustained by the presence of H2S originating from reduced hydrothermal fluids and oxygen in the seawater (5). Compared with free-living sulfur oxidizers, the symbionts benefit from high nutrient concentrations within the worm's body (6), which allow for a high metabolic activity. The microbially produced carbon compounds are transferred to the host, making R. pachyptila one of the fastest-growing marine invertebrates known (7). We took a functional genomics approach to analyze the proteome and hence to derive information on the physiology of the uncultured Riftia symbionts. The sequencing of the symbiont genome was conducted by a metagenome approach. Bacterial symbionts were isolated and separated from the host tissue, the so-called trophosome (8). Using one- and two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis, we established reference maps (master gels) of the soluble intracellular and the membrane-associated bacterial proteome, on which more than 220 identified proteins have been registered so far (Fig. 1 and fig. S1). Our procedures were reproducible and showed the presence of a single endosymbiont species (9) with no indication of other bacterial or host tissue contaminants. The proteomic approach provided evidence regarding which of the predicted genes are expressed under natural growth conditions. Levels of protein synthesis reflect the relative proportion of translational capacity that is invested in the individual metabolic paths, and we can deduce the relevance of particular proteins for the symbionts' physiology. On the basis of our proteome data, we were thus able to deduce major pathways of the symbionts' metabolism, e.g., the sulfide oxidation pathway (fig. S2) and the reverse tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (fig. S3), as well as to make inferences about the symbionts' response to oxidative stress.

Although great advances have been made in our understanding of the sulfur oxidation pathways in a variety of sulfur oxidizers in recent years, this pathway remains incompletely characterized in Riftia symbionts. In this proteome study, the enzymes DsrA (dissimilatory sulfite reductase), AprA/AprB (adenosine phosphosulfate reductase), and SopT [adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sulfurylase] were identified, which suggested the reactions displayed in fig. S2: H2S is oxidized to SO 2-3 in a six-electron step; this is subsequently converted to adenosine phosphosulfate (APS), with consumption of adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The final oxidation step yields ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation and simultaneously creates the end product, SO 2-4. Although these enzymes were originally described as part of the reverse pathway in sulfate-reducing bacteria (as reflected in their names), it has long been proposed that they can function just as well in the opposite direction (10). Quantitative analyses of the respective protein spots in our study revealed that the three major sulfide oxidation proteins DsrA, AprA/AprB, and SopT constitute more than 12% of the total cytosolic symbiont proteome in a pH range of 4 to 7. This highlights the essential role of these enzymes for the symbiont's energy metabolism. Using our intracellular protein master gel, we also examined the Riftia symbiont's carbon metabolism. We identified most of the enzymes involved in the energy-generating TCA cycle. Moreover, we found the enzyme 2-oxoglutarate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase subunit (KorB), several copies of a pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (subunits Por1, Por2, and PorA/PorG), a putative fumarate reductase (subunits SdhA/SdhC), and a protein highly similar to a citryl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase subunit (CcsB). These enzymes could run the TCA cycle in the reductive direction (fig. S3). This cycle represents an alternative CO2 fixation mechanism that requires less energy than the Calvin cycle for each three-carbon unit formed. Considering the great abundance of these four key enzymes on the protein gels (see relative spot volumes in table S1), we suggest that the reductive TCA cycle is not only a possibility, but a very important feature of the Riftia symbiont's carbon metabolism. To verify the symbiont'scapabilityforusingthe reductive TCA cycle for CO2 fixation, we tested cell extracts of isolated bacteria for activity of the above-mentioned key enzymes: The assays clearly revealed specific enzyme activities in all four cases that are higher than those previously reported for ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO) (11) (table S2). The results of our proteome analysis, in combination with the measured enzyme activities, provide strong evidence that the Riftia symbionts, which have been considered a prime example for chemolithoautotrophic carbon fixation via the Calvin cycle, use, at least partly, the reductive TCA cycle for autotrophic carbon fixation as well. This might explain the long-standing dilemma that the stable carbon isotopic composition of the Riftia symbiont is substantially heavier (13Cof -9 to -16) than would be expected by the use of the Calvin cycle alone (12). The observed isotopic variation most likely results from varying contributions by the reductive TCA cycle and the Calvin cycle. It is also interesting to note that, concordant with previous findings (12), RuBisCO constitutes only 1/21% of the Riftia symbiont'stotal protein on our gels. This is a small percentage compared with other bacteria that use only the Calvin cycle for CO2 fixation, where RuBisCO is usually the major protein and can account for 4 to 50% of the total soluble protein (13). The apparent discrepancy between the low concentration and the relatively high activity of RuBisCO in the trophosome (4) and the possible occurrence of two carbon fixation pathways in one organism certainly warrant further investigations. Riftia symbionts can store elemental sulfur in their periplasm if high concentrations of H2S are available (14); these stores result in a light green, almost yellow trophosome. The tissue appears dark green or black (15) when sulfur is limiting. To analyze the symbionts' potential responses to changing environmental conditions, we compared bacterial protein patterns from naturally occurring sulfur-rich and from sulfur-depleted trophosome tissues. Under high-sulfide conditions, the resulting 2D gels revealed a distinctly higher spot intensity for enzymes involved in sulfide oxidation and for RuBisCO, compared with low-sulfur conditions (Table 1, Fig. 2). Spot intensities of the sulfide oxidation enzymes AprA and DsrA were about eight and four times, respectively, those under low-sulfur conditions. This indicates that Riftia symbionts are capable of adjusting the production of enzymes needed for energy metabolism to the prevailing environmental conditions. In bacteria from tissue with little or no stored sulfur (dark trophosomes), the protein spot volume of the putative fumarate reductase subunit SdhA was about 24 times as high as, and the spot volume of the putative pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase Por1 was about 9 times as high as that in sulfur-rich, light trophosome (Fig. 2, Table 1). Several other enzymes involved in the reductive TCA cycle, including two other pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase subunits, PorG and PorA, and the 2-oxoglutarate synthase subunit KorB, could also be detected with elevated spot volumes in samples from sulfur-depleted trophosomes. This suggests that the Riftia symbiont might be capable of adapting to a temporary low-energy situation by adjusting its way of carbon fixation: The use of the Calvin cycle might be reduced in favor of the up-regulation of the energetically more favorable reductive TCA cycle. Because Riftia symbionts have also been shown to produce glycogen as a carbon storage compound (16), it might even be speculated that-for example, under long-lasting or severe low-energy conditions-their metabolism switches from an autotrophic mode to a heterotrophic mode. In this case, the symbiont might revert to burning carbon reserves through glycolysis and the oxidative TCA cycle to generate energy and precursors for biosynthesis. The symbiont might thus be able to use the TCA cycle in the oxidative and reductive direction, depending on the environmental conditions, which would allow for a high metabolic flexibility. Apparently, the true nature of the Riftia symbiont's metabolic strategies is much more complex than expected. Further detailed investigations are needed to explicitly evaluate and validate these hypotheses. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

This result is supported by the lack of the respective gene in the metagenome sequence. Because Riftia symbionts do not tolerate high oxygen concentrations (18), we tested their strategy of coping with stress situations caused by hydrogen peroxide. Our experiments revealed a strong induction of the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpC (Fig. 3). This enzyme is present in large amounts in the cytoplasmic protein fraction (Fig. 1) and reduces organic hydroperoxides caused by H2O2. Our results indicate that AhpC plays a crucial role in the resistance of these microaerophilic bacteria to oxidative stress. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3. Comparison of protein patterns in response to oxidative stress. The 2D gels show proteins from samples taken before and 60 min after the addition of 2 mM H2O2 to a suspension of isolated Riftia symbionts. Both images were colored (control, green spots, and stress sample, red spots) and overlaid. The oxidative stress protein AhpC is indicated. Because of the delayed deformylation of the newly synthesized protein during the massive induction of AhpC production, the protein spot shifts to a slightly more acidic pH. The "new" AhpC, produced after the stress with H2O2 is thus visible as red spots right next to the "old" AhpC, visible as green spots. This study shows that a comparative proteomic view of the Riftia symbionts' cell physiology allows for a complex physiological description without their cultivation. It reaches beyond the mere prediction of putative metabolic functions as coded in the genome sequence.
Abstract Even at extragalactic distances, the shape of supernova ejecta can be effectively diagnosed by spectropolarimetry. We present results for 17 type Ia supernovae that allow a statistical study of the correlation among the geometric structures and other observable parameters of type Ia supernovae. These observations suggest that type Ia supernova ejecta typically consist of a smooth, central, iron-rich core and an outer layer with chemical asymmetries. The degree of this peripheral asphericity is correlated with the light-curve decline rate of type Ia supernovae. These results lend strong support to delayed-detonation models of type Ia supernovae. Different supernova (SN) explosion mechanisms may lead to differently structured ejecta. Type Ia supernovae (SNe) have been used as premier tools for precision cosmology. They occur when a carbon and oxygen white dwarf reaches the Chandrasekhar stability limit, probably because of mass accretion in a binary system, and is disrupted in a thermonuclear explosion (1). Decade-long debates have discussed how the explosive nuclear burning is triggered and how it propagates through the progenitor star (2-6). Successful models generally start with a phase of subsonic nuclear burning, or deflagration, but theorists disagree on whether the burning front becomes supersonic after the earlier phase of deflagration. An explosion that does turn into supersonic burning is called delayed detonation (4). The resulting chemical structures are dramatically different for deflagration (5) and delayed-detonation models (7). For a pure deflagration model, chemical clumps are expected to be present at all velocity layers that burning has reached (5). For delayed detonation, the detonation front propagates through the ashes left behind by deflagration, burns partially burned or unburned elements further into heavier elements, and erases the chemically clumpy structures generated by deflagration. The polarized emission from a supernova is caused by electron scattering in its ejecta. It is sensitive to the geometric structure of the ejecta (8). Electron scattering in an asymmetric ejecta would produce nonzero degrees of polarization (8). In continuum light, normal SNe Ia are only polarized up to about 0.3%, but polarization as high as 2% is found across some spectral lines (9-14). The polarization decreases with time and vanishes around 2 weeks past optical maximum. The low level of continuum polarization implies that the SN Ia photospheres are, in general, almost spherical. The decrease of polarization at later times suggests that the outermost zones of the ejecta are more aspherical than the inner zones. Similarly, the large polarization across certain spectral lines implies that the layers above the photosphere are highly aspheric and most likely chemically clumpy (12-15). In this study, we report polarimetry of 17 SNe Ia. These are all the SNe Ia for which we have premaximum polarimetry. The observations (Table 1) were collected with the 2.1-m Otto Struve Telescope of the McDonald Observatory of the University of Texas and with one of the 8.2-m unit telescopes of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO). The typical spectral resolution of these observations is 1.2 nm, and the wavelength range is typically from 400 nm to 850 nm. The total exposure time was longer than 4 hours for data taken with the 2.1-m telescope and was around 1 to 2 hours for the ESO VLT data. Only SNe observed before optical maximum were included. We restricted ourselves to the characteristic Si II 635.5-nm line [
Abstract We describe the genome sequence of the protist Trichomonas vaginalis, a sexually transmitted human pathogen. Repeats and transposable elements comprise about two-thirds of the 1/2160-megabase genome, reflecting a recent massive expansion of genetic material. This expansion, in conjunction with the shaping of metabolic pathways that likely transpired through lateral gene transfer from bacteria, and amplification of specific gene families implicated in pathogenesis and phagocytosis of host proteins may exemplify adaptations of the parasite during its transition to a urogenital environment. The genome sequence predicts previously unknown functions for the hydrogenosome, which support a common evolutionary origin of this unusual organelle with mitochondria. Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protist that causes trichomoniasis, a common but overlooked sexually transmitted human infection, with 1/2170 million cases occurring annually worldwide (1). The extracellular parasite resides in the urogenital tract of both sexes and can cause vaginitis in women and urethritis and prostatitis in men. Acute infections are associated with pelvic inflammatory disease, increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. T. vaginalis is a member of the parabasilid lineage of microaerophilic eukaryotes that lack mitochondria and peroxisomes but contain unusual organelles called hydrogenosomes. Although previously considered to be one of the earliest branching eukaryotic lineages, recent analyses leave the evolutionary relationship of parabasalids to other major eukaryotic groups unresolved (2, 3). In this article, we report the draft sequence of T. vaginalis, the first parabasalid genome to be described. Genome structure, RNA processing, and lateral gene transfer. The T. vaginalis genome sequence, generated using whole-genome shotgun methodology, contains 1.4 million shotgun reads assembled into 17,290 scaffolds at 1/27.2* coverage (4). At least 65% of the T. vaginalis genome is repetitive (table S1). Despite several procedures developed to improve the assembly (4), the superabundance of repeats resulted in a highly fragmented sequence, preventing investigation of T. vaginalis genome architecture. The repeat sequences also hampered measurement of genome size, but we estimate it to be 1/2160 Mb (4). A core set of 1/260,000 protein-coding genes was identified (Table 1), endowing T. vaginalis with one of the highest coding capacities among eukaryotes (table S2). Introns were identified in 65 genes, including the 1/220 previously documented (5). Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) for all 20 amino acids were found, and 1/2250 ribosomal DNA (rDNA) units were identified on small contigs and localized to one of the six T. vaginalis chromosomes (Fig. 1).

(C) In contrast, the Tvmar1 transposable element (8) is dispersed throughout the genome. Table 1. Summary of the T. vaginalis genome sequence data. Assembly size (bp, base pairs) includes all contigs and differs from estimated genome size of 1/2160 Mb (4). The scaffold size is the minimum scaffold length, such that more than half the genome is contained in scaffolds of at least that length. The number of predicted genes may include low-complexity repeats or novel transposable elements rather than true T. vaginalis genes, but in the absence of decisive evidence these remain in the gene set. The number of evidence-supported genes includes those with either similarity to a known protein (E 25% length of protein) or similarity to an expressed sequence tag (>95% identity over >90% length of the gene). A total of 763 rDNA fragments (258 copies of 28S, 254 copies of 18S, and 251 copies of 5.8S) were identified.

Intriguingly, the eukaryotic transcription machinery of T. vaginalis appears more metazoan than protistan (table S3 to S5). The presence of a T. vaginalis Dicer-like gene, two Argonaute genes, and 41 transcriptionally active DEAD-DEAH-box helicase genes suggests the existence of an RNA interference (RNAi) pathway (fig. S1). Identification of these components raises the possibility of using RNAi technology to manipulate T. vaginalis gene expression. During genome annotation, we identified 152 cases of possible prokaryote-to-eukaryote lateral gene transfer (LGT) [tables S6 and S7 and
Abstract A major goal of systems biology is to predict the function of biological networks. Although network topologies have been successfully determined in many cases, the quantitative parameters governing these networks generally have not. Measuring affinities of molecular interactions in high-throughput format remains problematic, especially for transient and low-affinity interactions. We describe a high-throughput microfluidic platform that measures such properties on the basis of mechanical trapping of molecular interactions. With this platform we characterized DNA binding energy landscapes for four eukaryotic transcription factors; these landscapes were used to test basic assumptions about transcription factor binding and to predict their in vivo function. Systems biology focuses on understanding the collective properties of biological networks; these networks in turn describe interactions between as many as thousands of unique elements. In recent years, knowledge of biological networks has grown dramatically, mainly because of the development and application of novel genomic (1-3) and proteomic methods (4-8) as well as bottom-up approaches such as genetic network engineering (9, 10). But as network topologies are becoming well characterized, information about the elements comprising these networks has remained minimal and in the realm of low-throughput biology. In order to model and predict the behavior of these complex systems, the underlying interactions between elements will have to be quantitatively characterized. Quantifying the affinities of molecular interactions is a considerable technical challenge. First, any particular biological interaction is governed by a large number of variables. Therefore, obtaining equilibrium dissociation constants requires one to perform dozens of assays as the concentrations of various components are systematically varied, increasing the number of measurements needed in an already logistically challenging problem. A second and more fundamental problem is the fact that many molecular interactions are transient and exhibit nanomolar to micromolar affinities, leading to rapid loss of bound material or little bound material in the first place. These factors are problematic for high-throughput methods such as yeast two-hybrid (6) and tandem affinity purification mass spectrometry (4, 5), where transient interactions are frequently missed. Protein-protein (11) and protein-DNA binding microarrays (PBMs) (12-14) are especially susceptible because of their stringent wash requirements, causing rapid loss of weakly bound material. Protein arrays have been applied to quantify ligand-ErbB receptor interactions (11), with off rates determined by surface plasmon resonance to be on the order of 10-4 s-1 (15). PBMs have been applied in a semiquantitative manner to transcription factor (TF) motif analysis for high-affinity interactions, with off rates on the order of 10-3 s-1 (12-14). We developed a high-throughput microfluidic platform (Fig. 1) capable of detecting low-affinity transient binding events on the basis of the mechanically induced trapping of molecular interactions (MITOMI), which eliminates the off-rate problem facing current array platforms and allows for absolute affinity measurements. We used MITOMI to map the binding energy landscapes of four eukaryotic TFs belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family by collecting over 41,000 individual data points from more than 17 devices and covering titrations over 464 target DNA sequences. These binding energy topographies allowed us to (i) predict in vivo function for two yeast TFs, (ii) make a comprehensive test of the base additivity assumption, and (iii) test the hypothesis that the basic region alone determines binding specificity of bHLH TFs.

(G) to (I) correspond to the states schematically shown in (D) to (F) (scale bars, 50 1/2m). bHLH motifs represent the third largest TF family in eukaryotes and regulate a wide variety of cellular functions ranging from cell proliferation and development to metabolism (16). We studied isoforms A and B of the human TF MAX, which together with other bHLH members play a role in cellular proliferation and many cancers (17). We also studied the yeast TFs Pho4p and Cbf1p; the former regulates phosphate metabolism (18, 19), whereas the latter regulates methionine synthesis as well as chromosome segregation, serving a structural role in the kinetochore (20-22). bHLH TFs generally bind to a consensus sequence of 5'-CANNTG-3' (where N is any nucleotide) called enhancer box (E-box) (fig. S1, A and B), which was later found to be the second most conserved motif in higher eukaryotes (3). Members of the bHLH family show mid- to low nanomolar DNA binding affinities and have off rates above 10-2 s-1 for their consensus sequences (23, 24), with orders of magnitude higher off rates for nonconsensus sequences. This transience makes the use of conventional microarrays impractical. The TF binding energy topographies were measured with highly integrated microfluidic devices (25, 26) containing 2400 independent unit cell experiments (Fig. 1, A and B). Each device is controlled by 7233 valves fabricated by multilayer soft lithography (MSL) (27) and programmed with a 2400-spot DNA microarray (28). The 2400 chambers are arranged into 24 rows addressed via a resistance equalizer (Fig. 1A); this ensures that flow velocities are equal across all rows, resulting in uniform surface derivatization and TF deposition. To avoid time-consuming cloning and protein synthesis and purification steps, we synthesized the TFs in situ via wheat germ-based in vitro transcription and translation (ITT). We designed a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method that generates linear expression-ready templates directly from yeast genomic DNA or cDNA clones (fig. S2). This approach allowed us to not only rapidly screen new TFs but also easily create and test structural chimeras. We synthesized libraries of Cy5-labeled target DNA sequences that comprehensively cover the E-box motif and flanking bases by permuting up to four bases at a time (fig. S1C and data set 1). Dilution series for each target DNA sequence were spotted as microarrays with column and row pitches of 563 1/2m and 281 1/2m, respectively. These arrays were used to program the microfluidic devices by aligning each spot to a unit cell. The ability to program devices with microarrays simplifies the microfluidic infrastructure and increases unit cell density. The use of microarrays for device programming is highly modular because any soluble substance or suspension may be arrayed, and it provides an elegant and efficient solution to the world-to-chip interface problem. Approximately attomoles of DNA and TF are required for each data point. Each unit cell is controlled by three micromechanical valves (27) as well as a "button" membrane (fig. S3) used for surface derivatization and MITOMI (Fig. 1, B to I, and fig. S4). When the button is actuated, it physically blocks a 60-1/2m circular area on the slide, preventing molecules from entering or leaving that part of the surface. The contact area can be precisely modulated by choice of button diameter and closing pressures (fig. S3). During surface derivatization, a circular area is masked with the button, while the rest of the surface is passivated with biotinylated bovine serum albumin. When the button is released, the previously protected circular area is specifically functionalized with biotinylated antibody against His5 (fig. S4, C to G). After surface patterning, the device is loaded with wheat germ-based ITT mixture containing linear DNA template coding for the TF to be synthesized, and each unit cell is isolated by closing a set of micromechanical valves. The device is incubated at 30C for 90 min to complete TF synthesis, solvation of target DNA, and equilibration of TF and target DNA (fig. S4, H and I). After the incubation period, MITOMI is performed by again actuating the button membrane and trapping surface-bound complexes (Fig. 1, D to I, and fig. S4, J to L). Initial contact of the membrane with the surface occurs medially and extends radially outward. Radial closure prevents solvent pockets from forming between the two interfaces and effectively creates zero dead volume while preserving the equilibrium concentrations of the molecular interactions to be detected. The trapped molecules are subsequently quantified with a DNA array scanner (fig. S5). Device characterization and control experiments are described in the

This article has a correction. Please see:Is corrected by - February 23, 2007 Abstract A large electric field at the surface of a ferromagnetic metal is expected to appreciably change its electron density. In particular, the metal's intrinsic magnetic properties, which are commonly regarded as fixed material constants, will be affected. This requires, however, that the surface has a strong influence on the material's properties, as is the case with ultrathin films. We demonstrated that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of ordered iron-platinum (FePt) and iron-palladium (FePd) intermetallic compounds can be reversibly modified by an applied electric field when immersed in an electrolyte. A voltage change of -0.6 volts on 2-nanometer-thick films altered the coercivity by -4.5 and +1% in FePt and FePd, respectively. The modification of the magnetic parameters was attributed to a change in the number of unpaired d electrons in response to the applied electric field. Our device structure is general and should be applicable for characterization of other thin-film magnetic systems. Spin electronics has recently emerged as a field of science and technology in which the electron's spin is directly exploited. Giant magnetoresistance and tunnel magneto-resistance sensors, used in read heads of hard disks, are both examples of the application of spin-electronic devices. In contrast, there are very few active (i.e., non-sensor) systems that exploit spin electronics. Such systems are operated through electrical current actuation, which requires much larger energy consumption than electric field (E) actuation used in usual electronic circuits and/or electromechanical systems. E actuation of magnetic properties has been demonstrated in the semiconducting (Ir,Mn) As system, in which the Curie temperature TC was varied by 1 K under a voltage of 125 V, corresponding to an electric field of approximately 1.6 * 108 V/m (1, 2). However, the possible applications of this phenomenon are limited as a result of the low TC of magnetic semiconductors (HC (relative to the value at -400 mV) versus U for FePt and FePd. A change of voltage U = -600 mV results in a HC by -4.5% for FePt and +1% for FePd films with a thickness of 2 nm. The 4-nm-thick films show a lower variation of -1% for FePt and no variation (within experimental resolution) for FePd. The observed change in HC as a function of U was essentially reversible, and the Kerr signal variation with magnetic field was the same upon increasing E as upon decreasing it. Both results imply that the observed effect is intrinsic and not due to film contamination or degradation that would be associated with the occurrence of irreversible phenomena (8). Note that HC is stronger than a linear response in all cases. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

(A) Change of the film coercivity for FePt and FePd with external voltage at given thicknesses and (B) change of the Kerr rotation for the 2-nm-thick FePt film with regard to (w.r.t.) the value at -400 mV. Error bars indicate the statistical variation () of the measurements. In addition to the effect of E on the coercivity, an increase in the Kerr rotation by 3% is observed upon changing U from -400 to -1000 mV for the 2-nm-thick FePt film. Within experimental accuracy, no such effect was found in the other samples. The results reveal that the magnetic properties of itinerant electron magnetic systems can be changed in a controlled way under E. During the measurements, the film microstructure is expected to remain essentially unaltered (to the extent that the very slow irreversible film degradation can be neglected), and, to first-order approximation, the coercivity can be assumed to be directly proportional to the KU from which it originates. The observed HC values were evaluated with respect to KU energies (MAE) derived from electronic structure calculations (9). A capacitance value C per surface area A of C/A = 30 1/2F/cm2 was used, because this is a typical value for a clean metal surface in an electrolyte such as PC that is characterized by a large dielectric constant k = 66 (10). Under a voltage U that acts almost exclusively at the FePt/PC interface because of the 30 times larger surface area of the Pt counter electrode as compared to the sample surface, a charge CU accumulates in the whole film volume Ad, where d is the film thickness. Considering that the volume of the L10 FePt or FePd primitive cell is Vcell = a2c/2 = 0.027 nm3, where a is 0.385 nm and c is 0.371 nm, the charge variation per unit cell becomes (1) In particular, for U = 600 mV and d = 2 nm, this amounts to 0.015 electrons per unit cell. From electronic structure calculations (9), a decrease of the MAE by 200% per electron is predicted for FePt and an increase of the MAE by 70% per electron is predicted for FePd. This result corresponds to expected changes of -3% and +1% for 2-nm-thick FePt and FePd, respectively. The induced excess charge in such metallic films is concentrated close to the surface and not distributed homogeneously. However, to first-order approximation, the anisotropy variation depends solely on the total film excess charge. This is a direct consequence of the linearity of all operations (i.e., it does not make a difference whether an anisotropy distribution is calculated first and then averaged over the whole film or whether the electron distribution is averaged right away). The sign and magnitude of HC that was measured agree well with the calculations for both alloys. It is quite notable that this simple concept is sufficient to explain the experimental results. Considering that we are dealing with ultrathin films, surface anisotropy should be included in the comparison between the experiment and calculation. However, neither experimental nor calculated data are available on the surface anisotropy of FePt. As a very qualitative argument, it may be argued that surface anisotropy in FePt is not expected to be dominant to the same extent as it is in cubic systems where surface symmetry breaking is the only source for the occurrence of a second-order anisotropy term. It has been shown (11) that there is only a weak thickness dependence of the nucleation field in FePt down to 2 nm, which supports this assumption. The fact that the voltage dependence of the coercivity is stronger than a linear response can be attributed to a change in the thickness of the electrolytic double layer with U: When the charge is increased at the sample surface, the double layer is compressed and, in turn, C and E acting on thesampleare increased. Because the Kerr angle is another intrinsic material property, its variation (detected in FePt only) upon the application of a voltage is another proof of the influence of E on the magnetic properties. However, in the absence of any calculated data, it is not possible to discuss the importance of the observed effect any further. Our results have shown that the magnetic properties of thin-film ferromagnetic systems can be varied in a controlled way by an applied electric field. It must be stressed that the majority of modern magnetic materials belong to this category of materials. Beyond this proof of principle, this approach could offer an alternative and attractive generic actuation mechanism for electronic and electromechanical systems.
Abstract The cross-plane thermal conductivity of thin films of WSe2 grown from alternating W and Se layers is as small as 0.05 watts per meter per degree kelvin at room temperature, 30 times smaller than the c-axis thermal conductivity of single-crystal WSe2 and a factor of 6 smaller than the predicted minimum thermal conductivity for this material. We attribute the ultralow thermal conductivity of these disordered, layered crystals to the localization of lattice vibrations induced by the random stacking of two-dimensional crystalline WSe2 sheets. Disordering of the layered structure by ion bombardment increases the thermal conductivity. Materials with the lowest thermal conductivity are typically found among electrically insulating amorphous solids and glasses. In these materials, heat conduction is adequately predicted by a simple phenomenological model, the minimum thermal conductivity, in which heat conduction is described by a random walk of vibrational energy on the time and length scales of atomic vibrations and inter-atomic spacings (1). More sophisticated theories of heat conduction in disordered materials support this description: A majority of the vibrational modes [termed "diffusons" by Allen and Feldman (2)] carry heat in this manner, and only a small fraction of the vibrational modes propagate as waves or are localized and therefore unable to contribute to heat conduction. Recently, we (3) and others (4) have shown that the minimum thermal conductivity can be circumvented in multilayer thin films of metals and oxides. When the spacing between the interfaces is only a few nanometers, the thermal resistance of the interfaces reduces the thermal conductivity far below the thermal conductivity of the homogeneous amorphous oxide. Here, we demonstrated by both experiment and computer simulation an alternative route for achieving ultralow thermal conductivity in a dense solid. The thermal conductivity of disordered thin films of the layered crystal WSe2 can be as small as 0.05 W m-1 K-1, a factor of 6 smaller than the predicted minimum thermal conductivity and, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest thermal conductivity ever observed in a fully dense solid. Disruption of the layered structure and the crystallinity of the WSe2 sheets by ion irradiation actually produces a marked increase in the thermal conductivity of the thin film. Thus, the lowest thermal conductivities are not found in the fully amorphous form of WSe2; rather, ultralow thermal conductivity is achieved by controlling both order and disorder, and hence the thermal pathways, in this anisotropic material. We synthesized WSe2 thin films by the modulated elemental reactants method (5, 6). Sequential bilayers of W and Se were deposited in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber onto unheated Si (100) wafers with a stoichiometry of 1:2 and then annealed for 1 hour at elevated temperatures in N2 atmosphere to form the desired layered structures (6). The microstructure of the films was stable at room temperature. In the WSe2 structure, a hexagonal plane of W atoms is bonded to two Se layers by strong covalent-ionic bonds, and each two-dimensional (2D) WSe2 sheet is bonded to adjacent sheets by weaker van der Waals forces (7, 8). We purchased a single crystal of WSe2 from Nanoscience Instruments to provide a baseline for comparisons. Thermal conductivity was measured by time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) (6, 9-12). In our implementation of TDTR, we determine the thermal conductivity by comparing the time dependence of the ratio of the in-phase Vin and out-of-phase Vout signals from the radio-frequency lock-in amplifier to calculations made with the use of a thermal model (11). The thermal model has several parameters, but the thermal conductivity of the WSe2 sample is the only important unknown. We used synchrotron x-ray diffraction to characterize the microstructure of a typical WSe2 film (Fig. 1). Data for (0 0 L) reflections (6) showed that the layering of the 2D WSe2 sheets was very precise; the surface normal to each sheet (hexagonal c axis) was well aligned with the surface normal of the substrate, and the spacing between the centers of WSe2 sheets was highly uniform at 0.66 nm. These highly textured films had completely random crystalline orientation in the a-b plane. We examined the crystalline structure of the film by scanning the diffraction intensity through reciprocal space where the (1 0 3) reflection intersected the Ewald sphere. The relatively narrow line width (0.06 in reciprocal lattice units) in the direction parallel to the surface, [h 0 3], gave a lateral coherence length of 23 nm (Fig. 1C). Scans through the intersection of (1 0 L) reflections with the Ewald sphere probed the coherence of the crystal structure along the direction normal to the WSe2 sheets. The large line widths (Fig. 1B) indicated that crystallographic ordering in the stacking of the WSe2 sheets was limited to C in a N2 atmosphere. (A) False-color depiction of the x-ray diffraction intensities collected by the area detector in the vicinity of the (1 0 3) and (1 0 5) reflections.

The scan direction is shown as the vertical red line in (A). (C) Scan of the x-ray diffraction in the in-plane direction. The scan direction is shown as the horizontal red line in (A). We next compared the thermal conductivity of annealed WSe2 films to the conductivity of a single crystal of WSe2 and the predicted minimum thermal conductivity (Fig. 2). The thermal conductivity of single-crystal WSe2 was approximately proportional to 1/T (the reciprocal of absolute temperature), as expected for a dielectric or semiconductor in which heat transport is dominated by phonons with mean-free paths limited by anharmonicity. Calculations of the minimum thermal conductivity require knowledge of the number density of atoms and the speed of sound (1). We used picosecond acoustics to measure the longitudinal speed of sound in the cross-plane direction of nominal 360-nm-thick films and found that vL = 1.6 nm ps-1 (13, 14). This measurement is in good agreement with an independent measurement of the same film (vL = 1.7 nm ps-1) with the use of picosecond interferometry (15) and an index of refraction at the laser wavelength of 800 nm of n = 4.13. If we use the average of these values, vL = 1.65 nm ps-1, and a mass density of = 9.2 g cm-3, we obtain an elastic constant C33 = 25 GPa, which is approximately a factor of 2 smaller than C33 for single crystals of NbSe2 and TaSe2 measured by neutron scattering (16) and single-crystal WSe2 measured by picosecond interferometry. The transverse speed of sound vT is not accessible to the standard methods of picosecond acoustics; instead, we estimated vT = 1.15 based on our measurement of vL and the ratio C44/C33 previously measured for NbSe2 and TaSe2 (16).

Each curve is labeled by the film thickness. Data for a bulk single crystal are included for comparison. Error bars are the uncertainties propagated from the various experimental parameters used to analyze the data (6). The ion-irradiated sample (irrad) was subjected to a 1-MeV Kr+ ion dose of 3 * 1015 cm-2. The dashed line marked min is the calculated minimum thermal conductivity for WSe2 films in the cross-plane direction. The lowest thermal conductivity, , measured at 300 K is = 0.048 W m-1 K-1 for a 62-nm-thick WSe2 film, 30 times smaller than the cross-plane thermal conductivity of a single-crystal sample of WSe2 (Fig. 2) and a factor of 6 smaller than the predicted minimum thermal conductivity. This degree of deviation from the predicted minimum thermal conductivity in a homogeneous material is unprecedented (17). Notably, the conductivity of the 62-nm-thick film is smaller than the conductivity of a thinner film (24 nm) or a thicker film (343 nm). The reasons for these differences are not understood in detail, but we speculate that variations in the degree of crystallographic ordering along the thickness of the films are playing an important role. The data shown in Figs. 1 and 2 lead us to conclude that the ultralow thermal conductivities are produced by random stacking of well-crystallized WSe2 sheets. To test this idea, we used irradiation by energetic heavy ions to disrupt the crystalline order in the thin film samples (Fig. 3). Because our TDTR measurements require knowledge of the thermal conductivity of the substrate, bare silicon substrates were irradiated with the same range of ion fluences and measured by TDTR (6). At the highest ion dose, 3 * 1015 ions cm-2, we observed a factor of 5 increase in the thermal conductivity of the WSe2 film. This increase in thermal conductivity with ion beam damage is also unprecedented. We inferred from these experiments that ion-induced damage introduces disorder that reduces localization of vibrational energy and enhances the transfer of vibrational energy in the material.

Samples were irradiated with 1-MeV Kr+ ions to the dose indicated on the x axis of the plot. Error bars are the uncertainties propagated from the various experimental parameters used to analyze the data (6). To gain further insight and confidence in our experimental results, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on model structures. For simplicity and computational efficiency, the atomic interactions in our model compound are described by 6-12 Lennard-Jones potentials: (1) where mu is the energy scale and is the length scale. Two sets of mu and parameters were used: For interactions within a single WSe2 sheet, mu = 0.91 eV and = 2.31 A, and for the interaction between layers, mu = 0.08 eV and = 3.4 A. These parameters achieved a good fit to WSe2 crystal structure and the C11 (200 GPa) and C33 (50 GPa) elastic constants. For computation efficiency, a cutoff of 5.4 A was used, with both energy and forces shifted such that they were zero at the cutoff (18). The cross-sectional area of the simulation cell is 15.3 * 13.3 A. Along the (001) direction, two sizes were selected: 160 and 320 A. Periodic boundary conditions were used for all directions. Newton's equations of motions were solved by the fifth-order predictor corrector algorithm (18) with an MD time step, t = 1.8 * 10-15 s. The simulation cell for the thermal transport measurement is depicted in Fig. 4. To calculate the thermal conductivity, the we first equilibrated the structure at T = 300 K for 100,000 MD time steps. Next, the global thermostat was turned off and thermal energy was added to one WSe2 sheet and removed from a second sheet, which was located at a distance from the first sheet equal to one-half of the size of the simulation cell along the (001) direction (19, 20). Atomic velocities were scaled such that heat was added or subtracted at a constant rate, 10-6 eV per MD time step (21). We monitored the temperature profile by averaging the kinetic energy of atoms in each WSe2 sheet. Because of the small energy barrier for shearing of the WSe2 structure and the small cross-sectional area of the simulation cell, our model structures exhibited thermally excited local shearing events leading to disorder in the stacking of the WSe2 sheets (Fig. 4).

The positions of the heat sink and source separated by 8 nm are indicated. (B) The steady-state temperature profile obtained from the nonequilibrium, heat source-sink method. The solid line depicts a linear fit to the central region between the heat source and sink. The dashed line is an analogous fit but for the structure with doubled size along the z direction with the corresponding separation between the heat source and sink of 16 nm. After 5 to 20 million MD steps (depending on the system size), a steady-state temperature distribution was established (Fig. 4). The temperature gradient, and thus the thermal conductivity, of 16- and 32-nm-long simulation cells were essentially the same within the statistical standard deviation of 10%, = 0.06 W m-1 K-1. Given the approximate form of the potentials used in our computational work, the agreement between the measured and calculated thermal conductivities was better than we expected. Nevertheless, the low thermal conductivity of the model structure suggests that the ultralow thermal conductivity in disordered, layered crystals is a general phenomenon and not restricted to WSe2. Our WSe2 films are poor electrical conductors in the cross-plane direction; however, if semiconductors with similar structural features and good electrical mobility can be identified, disordered layered crystals may offer a promising route to improved materials for thermoelectric energy conversion.
Abstract Vapor deposition has been used to create glassy materials with extraordinary thermodynamic and kinetic stability and high density. For glasses prepared from indomethacin or 1,3-bis-(1-naphthyl)-5-(2-naphthyl)benzene, stability is optimized when deposition occurs on substrates at a temperature of 50 K below the conventional glass transition temperature. We attribute the substantial improvement in thermodynamic and kinetic properties to enhanced mobility within a few nanometers of the glass surface during deposition. This technique provides an efficient means of producing glassy materials that are low on the energy landscape and could affect technologies such as amorphous pharmaceuticals. Glassy materials combine the disordered structure of a liquid with the mechanical properties of a solid. Amorphous systems can be described in terms of a potential energy landscape, with thermodynamics and kinetics controlled by the minima and barriers on the landscape, respectively (1-3). Many important issues could be addressed if liquids or glasses with very low energies could be created (2, 4-6). For example, it might be possible to definitively understand the Kauzmann entropy crisis, an area of intense recent interest (1, 7-11). Kauzmann observed that if the entropy of many supercooled liquids is extrapolated to low temperature, the amorphous state is predicted to have a lower entropy than that of the highly ordered crystal well above absolute zero (5, 6). Glasses are usually prepared by cooling a liquid, but accessing low energy states by this route is impractically slow (4, 12). If a liquid avoids crystallization as it is cooled, molecular motion eventually becomes too slow to allow the molecules to find equilibrium configurations. This transition to a nonequilibrium state defines the glass transition temperature Tg. Glasses are "stuck" in local minima on the potential energy landscape (2, 3). Because glasses are thermodynamically unstable, lower energies in the landscape are eventually achieved through molecular rearrangements. However, this process is so slow that it is generally impossible to reach states deep in the landscape by this route. We have discovered that vapor deposition can bypass these kinetic restrictions and produce glassy materials that have extraordinary energetic and kinetic stability and unusually high densities. We demonstrate this for two molecular glass formers: 1,3-bis-(1-naphthyl)-5-(2-naphthyl)benzene (TNB) (Tg = 347 K) and indomethacin (IMC) (Tg = 315 K). For these systems, the most stable glasses are obtained when vapor is deposited onto a substrate controlled near Tg - 50 K. We argue that surface mobility during the deposition process is the mechanism of stable glass formation. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to examine the kinetics and thermodynamics of vapor-deposited samples created by heating crystalline TNB or IMC in a vacuum. Figure 1A shows DSC data for TNB vapor-deposited (blue) onto a substrate held at 296 K. This scan was continued beyond the melting point, after which the sample was cooled into the glass and then scanned again to yield the black curve. This latter curve represents the behavior of an ordinary glass of TNB, with Tg = 347 K, as defined by the onset temperature; it is consistent with previously reported results for TNB (13-15).

(A) Heat capacity, Cp, of TNB samples: vapor-deposited directly into a DSC pan at 296 K at a rate of 1/25 nm/s (blue); ordinary glass produced by cooling the liquid at 40 K/min (black); ordinary glass annealed at 296 K for 174 days (violet), 328 K for 9 days (gold), and 328 K for 15 days (green). (Inset) Structure of TNB. (B) Enthalpy of TNB and IMC samples. Heat capacities of the samples shown in (A) are integrated to obtain the curves shown for TNB. Similar experimental conditions were used for IMC (15). Remarkably, the vapor-deposited sample has a substantially higher onset temperature of 363 K. This result indicates that the vapor-deposited material is kinetically much more stable, because higher temperatures are required to dislodge the molecules from their glassy configurations. For comparison, we isothermally annealed the ordinary glass for 6 months at 296 K and up to 15 days at 328 K (equilibrium was reached at 328 K). Vapor-deposited samples created in only a few hours have much greater kinetic stability than ordinary glasses aged for many days or months below Tg. To quantify the thermodynamic stability of the vapor-deposited materials, we calculate the fictive temperature (Tf), as defined below. Lower Tf values indicate a lower position in the energy landscape. The enthalpy for TNB and IMC samples, obtained by integrating the heat capacity Cp, is plotted in Fig. 1B. The intersection between these data and the extrapolated supercooled liquid enthalpy (red curve) defines Tf for each sample. For both TNB and IMC, samples prepared by vapor deposition have considerably lower enthalpies and Tf values. On the basis of aging experiments on TNB, we estimate that it would require at least 40 years of annealing an ordinary glass to match Tf for the vapor-deposited sample shown in Fig. 1 (12). The similarity of the results for TNB and IMC suggests that vapor deposition can generally produce highly stable glasses. The thermodynamic stability of these films can also be quantified in comparison with the Kauzmann temperature (TK), the temperature at which the extrapolated entropy of the supercooled liquid equals that of the crystal (4, 5). We define a figure of merit: (1) For fragile glassformers such as TNB and IMC, K is a measure of position on the energy landscape, with a value of 1 (Tf = TK) indicating the lowest possible position on the landscape. For TNB, Magill estimated TK = 270 K (14). Vapor deposition of TNB at Tg - 50 K created films with K = 0.43; by this measure, we have proceeded 43% toward the bottom of the energy landscape for amorphous configurations. In comparison, annealing the ordinary glass at 296 K (K = 0.09) or 328 K (K = 0.22) is relatively ineffective. Similar results were observed for IMC deposited at Tg - 50 K, with K = 0.23 to 0.44, depending on deposition rate. These results can be put into context by comparison with Kovac's seminal aging experiments on poly(vinylacetate), where 2 months of annealing achieved K 0.17 (16). Vapor deposition can also create unusually dense glasses. The ratio of the density of vapor-deposited TNB (VD) to that of the ordinary glass (o, prepared by cooling from the liquid) increases as the deposition temperature is lowered toward Tg - 50 K (Fig. 2). Also shown as the solid line is a prediction of the density if vapor deposition produced an equilibrium supercooled liquid at the deposition temperature (12). For this range of deposition temperatures, our samples nearly achieve this upper bound for the density. If we define a fictive temperature based on density, deposition at 296 K produces Tf 300 K, slightly lower than the fictive temperature based on the enthalpy (15).

Density of vapor-deposited TNB films (VD) normalized to the density of the ordinary glass (o), with both measured at room temperature. Experimental density ratios (filled squares) were calculated from x-ray reflectivity measurements on 100- to 300-nm films by measuring film thickness before and after annealing above Tg (15). The solid line indicates the expected density if the samples were prepared in thermal equilibrium with Tf = Tdeposit. We have used neutron reflectivity to characterize diffusion in glasses of TNB. The high spatial resolution and large contrast in the scattering length of neutrons for hydrogen and deuterium nuclei make this an excellent technique for quantifying molecular motion. As schematically shown in the inset of Fig. 3, 300-nm films were prepared by alternately vapor-depositing 30-nm-thick layers of protio TNB (h-TNB) and deuterio TNB (d-TNB) (17). The specular reflectivity R was measured as a function of beam angle relative to the sample surface. This value, multiplied by q4 for clarity, is plotted as a function of the wave vector q. Reflectivity curves for samples vapor-deposited at different temperatures display diffraction peaks; as expected for our symmetric multilayer samples, only odd diffraction orders are present. For samples deposited at low temperature, diffraction can be observed up to the 13th order, indicating very sharp h-TNB/d-TNB interfaces (15). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3. Neutron reflectivity versus wave vector q for multilayer TNB films vapor-deposited at the specified temperatures. The peak intensities are determined by the sharpness of the h-TNB/d-TNB interfaces, which vary from 1.5 to 9 nm (full width at half maximum of the concentration profile derivative). The diffraction order of each peak is given by the numbers at the bottom. The inset illustrates the structure of the vapor-deposited sample (15). Time series of neutron reflectivity curves were obtained for two vapor-deposited samples during annealing at 342 K for samples deposited at 330 K (Fig. 4A) or 296 K (Fig. 4B). During 8 hours of annealing, all diffraction peaks (except the first-order peak) for sample A decayed to zero, indicating that substantial interfacial broadening had occurred because of interdiffusion of h-TNB/d-TNB. During the 16 hours of annealing at 342 K for sample B, no detectable interdiffusion occurred, even on the single-nanometer length scale. We emphasize that the only difference between these two samples was the temperature at which the substrate was held during deposition. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 4. Neutron reflectivity data for TNB multilayer films continuously annealed at 342 K. The substrate temperature during vapor deposition was (A) 330 K and (B) 296 K. The decay of the harmonic peaks in (A) occurred over 8 hours and is caused by bulk molecular diffusion (17). No detectible diffusion occurred in (B) over 16 hours (15). Figure 4A illustrates the behavior of an ordinary glass annealed near Tg; as shown elsewhere (17), interdiffusion in this sample is characteristic of the equilibrium liquid. In contrast, the sample deposited near Tg - 50 K (Fig. 4B) is kinetically much more stable, in qualitative agreement with the high onset temperature shown for the vapor-deposited sample in Fig. 1A. We can quantify the magnitude of this stability in terms of the equilibrium structural relaxation time , known to be 250 s at 342 K (18). The induction time for the sample deposited at Tg - 50 K exceeds 200 . Consistent with this result, we have observed in preliminary experiments that crystal growth rates in stable, vapor-deposited TNB glasses are slower than in ordinary glasses, although the former may contain crystal nuclei. The reflectivity curves in Fig. 3 provide insight into the mechanism that allows vapor deposition to create unusually stable glasses. The average h-TNB/d-TNB interface widths of the as-deposited samples were extracted from fits to the raw data (17) and ranged from 9 nm for the sample deposited at 339 K to 1.5 nm for deposition at 242 K. For all samples deposited at 296 K or above, the interfacial width exceeds the surface roughness (1/21.5 nm) as determined by x-ray and neutron reflectivity and the broadening estimated for bulk diffusion during the deposition process (17). Deposition at 242 K (Tg - 100 K) produced interfacial widths that are consistent with the surface roughness. Because the h-TNB/d-TNB interface widths for deposition temperatures above 242 K cannot be explained by surface roughness or bulk diffusion, we tentatively attribute them to enhanced mobility within a few nanometers of the surface of a TNB glass. Such mobility would explain both the broad interfaces observed in the as-deposited samples and the unusually stable glasses formed by vapor deposition. At the deposition rates used in our experiments (0.1 to 5 nm/s), TNB molecules would be a part of the mobile surface layer for 1/21 s before they are buried and become part of the bulk glass. If molecules at the surface can substantially rearrange in 1 s, they can find configurations that are near equilibrium configurations at the temperature of the substrate, even if the substrate is well below Tg. This rapid configuration sampling at the surface would, in a layer-by-layer fashion, produce a bulk glass that is low in the energy landscape with unusually high density and kinetic stability. It would also produce the broad interfaces observed for deposition at temperatures of 296 K and above. Enhanced surface dynamics similar to those in our proposed mechanism have been recently reported. By measuring voltage changes induced by the motions of implanted ions, Cowin and co-workers deduced a marked decrease of the viscosity for the top 3 nm of thin films of supercooled 3-methylpentane (19). Numerous studies have found evidence for enhanced mobility at the surface of glassy polymer films (20-23). The surface-mobility mechanism for the creation of unusually stable glasses is supported by an order-of-magnitude calculation. TNB samples vapor-deposited at 296 K have interface widths of 2.5 nm, clearly in excess of the width associated with surface roughness. We attribute the additional 1 nm of interface width to surface mobility and, given a deposition rate of 0.1 nm/s, the molecules are within the mobile surface layer for 10 s. Combining this length and time yields an estimate for the surface diffusion coefficient of 5 * 10-16 cm2/sec. For bulk TNB, this diffusion coefficient is found near Tg, where the structural relaxation time is a few seconds (17, 18). Thus, surface molecules plausibly remain mobile for several structural relaxation times before becoming buried, arguably long enough to find near-equilibrium configurations at 296 K. Given the widespread use of vapor-deposition techniques, it is surprising that unusually stable glasses have not been reported previously. In fact, it is commonly reported that vapor-deposition creates low-density glasses with low kinetic and thermodynamic stability (24-26). As compared with many reported depositions of metallic and organic materials, we have used lower deposition rates and/or substrate temperatures that are nearer to Tg. We observe the creation of highly stable glasses only for substrate temperatures Tdep/Tg in the vicinity of 0.85. Additionally, we observe that increasing the deposition rate can considerably decrease the stability of the glasses formed. These observations are all consistent with our proposed mechanism: Faster deposition does not allow as much time for equilibration at the surface and, at low enough temperature, surface molecules will rearrange too slowly to equilibrate. Indeed, the metallic glass community has known for decades that fast, low-temperature deposition is required to prepare high-energy glasses that quench thermodynamically unstable mixtures (27). We speculate that unusually stable glasses can be prepared for many systems that can be vapor-deposited, if surface mobility is enhanced and the substrate temperature is appropriately controlled. We anticipate that the availability of low-energy glasses prepared by vapor deposition and less general routes (28) will allow new insights into glass formation and the nature of the lower regions of the energy landscape. Stable glasses could also affect technologies such as amorphous pharmaceuticals, where stability against crystallization is required to retain the enhanced bioavailability of amorphous preparation.
Abstract Nanoparticles can be used as the building blocks for materials such as supracrystals or ionic liquids. However, they lack the ability to bond along specific directions as atoms and molecules do. We report a simple method to place target molecules specifically at two diametrically opposed positions in the molecular coating of metal nanoparticles. The approach is based on the functionalization of the polar singularities that must form when a curved surface is coated with ordered monolayers, such as a phase-separated mixture of ligands. The molecules placed at these polar defects have been used as chemical handles to form nanoparticle chains that in turn can generate self-standing films. Nanoparticles that consist of crystals of tens to thousands of atoms have been used as "artificial atoms" to form supracrystals that mimic ionic solids (1) or to form the nanoscale equivalent of ionic liquids (2). Breaking the interaction symmetry in these isotropic and almost spherical materials is a major challenge. It is increasingly evident that nanoparticles would become a much more powerful research tool if it were possible to place a known small number of molecules in their ligand shell to enable directional assembly, for example. This would enlarge the scope of potential applications, because anisotropic assemblies have distinctive properties that cannot be found or produced in isotropic assemblies (3, 4). Indeed, a large research effort to direct the assembly of nanoparticles (NPs), based primarily on biomolecules (5-9) or other templating agents (10), has been hindered by a lack of control over the number of receptors that interact with the templating agent. Approaches based solely on stoichiometry tend to require dilute aqueous solutions, resulting in limited throughput (11, 12). Recently, creative methods to introduce single valency in NPs have been developed, mostly through solid-state reactions (13-16). We present an approach to functionalize monolayer protected metal NPs at two diametrically opposed points that exist as a consequence of the topological nature (17, 18) of the particles. Specifically, we have made NPs that act as divalent building blocks ("artificial monomers"), and can be reacted with complementary divalent molecules to form chains that can then produce self-standing films. Monolayer protected metal NPs are supramolecular assemblies consisting of a metallic core coated with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) composed of one or more types of thiol-terminated molecules (ligands). It is known that molecules in SAMs on flat gold surfaces form a two-dimensional (2D) crystal in which every molecule conforms to the same tilt angle and direction relative to the surface normal (19, 20) in order to maximize the van der Waals interactions with its nearest neighbors. Landman and co-workers (21) addressed the question of the morphology of the ligand shell SAM on the faceted surface of a gold NP. They found that ligand molecules conform to one single tilt angle relative to a common particle diameter rather than assuming their equilibrium tilt angle on each crystallographic facet, which would generate a large number of line defects along facet edges. That is, the vectorial projection of the tilted ligand molecules propagates around the particle. This needs to be reconciled with the fact that on a topological sphere a 2D crystal cannot exist unless two separate point defects are present (22, 23). This is commonly known as the "hairy ball theorem" that states that it is not possible to "align hairs" onto a sphere without generating two singularities (such as the whirl on the back of our heads). Recently, we have shown (18, 24) that mixtures of thiolated molecules, which on flat gold surfaces separate into randomly distributed domains (25), form ordered alternating phases (ripples) when assembled on surfaces with a positive Gaussian curvature, such as the core of an NP (Fig. 1A). These types of domains will profoundly demarcate the two diametrically opposed singularities at the particle poles, where the rings collapse into points (Fig. 1B). We conjecture that, in the case of a self-assembled ligand shell, the polar singularities manifest themselves as defect points, that is, sites at which the ligands must assume a nonequilibrium tilt angle. Ligands at the poles, being not optimally stabilized by intermolecular interactions with their neighbors, should be the first molecules to be replaced in place-exchange reactions (SOM Text S1).

Gold NPs coated with a binary mixture of 1-nonanethiol (NT) and 4-methylbenzenethiol (MBT) were synthesized and characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Ordered rings similar in nature and spacing to the ones observed previously (18) were found. These molecules were chosen for multiple reasons: They have a strong driving force for phase separation and a large STM contrast, and are terminated with unreactive methyl groups. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine the size distribution and the molecular weight of the NPs. To place-exchange at the polar defects, the particles were dissolved in a solution containing 40 molar equivalents (relative to the moles of particles) of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) activated by N-hydroxysuccinimide. After stirring for 30 min, the reaction was rapidly quenched by filtration over a Sephadex column or by inducing precipitation with deionized water. A two-phase "polymerization" reaction inspired by the well-known procedure to synthesize nylon was then performed by combining an organic (toluene) phase containing the MUA functionalized particles with a water phase containing divalent 1,6-diaminohexane (DAH) (Fig. 1C). Within a few minutes, a precipitate begins to form at the water-toluene interface (fig. S1); after a few hours, the reaction reaches equilibrium. The precipitate can be re-dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dropped onto a TEM grid or, conversely, collected directly on a TEM grid and rinsed with THF. TEM images in both cases show a large population of linear chains of NPs, ranging from 3 to 20 NPs in length (Fig. 2). The low fraction of branched chains and the absence of 3D aggregates in the images strongly supports the idea of selective functionalization at the two opposed polar defects and suggests that polar singularities react even faster than other defects in the ligand shell.

TEM images of chains that compose the precipitate obtained when MUA pole-functionalized rippled NPs are reacted with DAH in a two-phase reaction. Scale bars 200 nm, inset 50 nm. Many control experiments were performed to observe the formation (or lack thereof) of a precipitate and the presence or absence of chains in TEM images of both the precipitate and the toluene phase (fig. S2). Mixed-ligand rippled NPs showed precipitate only when pole-functionalized with MUA, either activated or not activated. NPs containing carboxylic acid groups everywhere in the ligand shell formed, as expected, only large 3D aggregates resulting from nondirectional interparticle bonding. In general, precipitate was not observed when DAH was not present in the water phase or when the particles lacked carboxylic acid terminated ligands, proving that the precipitate is a product of an amide-coupling reaction leading to an amide bond (in the case of activation) or to a salt. A statistical analysis was performed on chains and controls resulting from one-phase syntheses (26). After analyzing more than 40 samples with a total population exceeding 50,000 particles, it was found that the average fraction of particles in chains was 20% (SD = 8%), whereas in all control experiments only 3 to 5% of the NPs were found in chainlike structures. The one-phase synthesis had a lower yield than the interfacial two-phase reaction. To further prove that the chains observed in our TEM images were due to molecular linking of our particles, the synthesis was performed with one of two divalent linking molecules of different lengths: DAH and O,O'-Bis(2 aminoethyl)octadecaethylene glycol (EGDA). We then measured the average interparticle separation along the chain (defined as the distance between the two nearest points or facets). Assuming an all-trans conformation for the molecular linkers (i.e., two MUA molecules covalently bonded to either DAH or EGDA), the expected interparticle distance would be 3.6 and 9.6 nm, respectively. Analysis of TEM images showed an average interparticle separation of 2.2 nm (SD = 0.4 nm) for DAH and of 4.2 nm (SD = 0.9 nm) for EGDA (Fig. 3A), proving that the observed chains are kept together by the molecular linkers. The larger spread in the EGDA distribution was expected because of its greater conformational freedom (Fig. 3B). Evidence that chains are present in solution (as opposed to being caused by solvent drying) was also obtained through light-scattering experiments. We found an increase in scattering intensity for THF solutions of chains as compared with solutions of identical optical density containing only the starting particles (fig. S3), proving the presence of aggregates in solution. Moreover, NPs of two different sizes (average diameter 10 and 20 nm, respectively) were pole-functionalized with 16-mercapto-1-hexadecylamine and reacted with sebacoyl chloride (a divalent molecule) to form chains of random composition (fig. S4). When the same particles were cast on a TEM grid without previous pole functionalization or without reacting with sebacoyl chloride, primarily isolated particles were obtained. To prove the dynamic nature of the chains, we exposed them to a large excess of NT for 3 days and observed only isolated particles in TEM images (fig. S5). Poles provide a distinctive way to place NPs on a surface with their ripples parallel to the substrate plane. STM images of samples prepared in this way lack the striations present when the sample is prepared such that the ripples are perpendicular to the substrate plane (fig. S6).

Place-exchange reactions have been thoroughly studied by Murray and co-workers (27-29). They found that molecules exchange first at defects in the ligand shell or at corners and edges of the core crystal. Using nuclear magnetic resonance, they calculated the initial rate of the ligand-exchange reaction: For 1-octanethiol-coated NPs they found a second-order reaction rate constant of 3 10-2 M-1 s-1 (27). In our system, the place-exchange reaction reaches equilibrium (at least for pole functionalization) after 10 min (30). Given that the number of NPs that contain at least one MUA molecule in their ligand shells can be experimentally evaluated (by making the conservative assumption that every MUA-functionalized particle will react to form an insoluble chain), the second-order rate constant was found to be 1.67 M-1 s-1, about two orders of magnitude larger than that observed for homoligand NPs (27). Applying the fastest second-order rate constant published (27), the number of MUA molecules that would have reacted at defects other than the poles under our reaction conditions is only 1 MUA molecule per 100 NPs. It should be pointed out that (i) we assume that every chain precipitates but observe few dimers in TEM images of the precipitate, hence they must still be soluble; and (ii) we assume that only one MUA molecule is located at each pole. Faster rates of reaction would be obtained if any of these assumptions were removed. These kinetic experiments show that defects at the molecularly defined polar singularities of mixed ligand NPs are thermodynamically distinct from those at crystallographically defined vertices of the core crystal. Most experiments were performed with particles with an average diameter of 1/24 nm; as the size of the particles changes, it is reasonable to expect that the rate of polar reactions will vary. The polar singularities will exist only in a certain size range: On surface hemispheres with a radius larger than 20 nm, ripples do not form (18), and a similar behavior is expected on NPs. Investigations are under way to determine the lower size limit; we have observed ripples and chains in NPs as small as 3 nm in diameter. Enough NP chains at the water-toluene interface have been produced to form a continuous film as large as 1 cm2 (fig. S7). Our preliminary conclusion is that these films (whose thickness can reach 60 1/2m) must be composed of multiple interwoven chains. Whereas the chains described here are soluble in dichloromethane (DCM), the films when placed in DCM quickly lose any unreacted particles but maintain their structural integrity and then take weeks to dissolve. The van der Waals interactions between the ligand shells of the particles together with the interchain morphology provide enough mechanical strength to make these purely NP films self-standing. Control experiments show that, in situations where chains are not formed, one of two extreme cases happen. When the entire ligand shell can react with diamine (e.g., there is carboxylic acid in the ligand shell), coarse powders that are insoluble in any solvent are formed. When the ligand shell cannot react with diamines, semicontinuous films form, but only after the toluene has completely evaporated; these materials can at times be self-standing but always readily dissolve in organic solvents.

Please see:Is corrected by - February 16, 2007 Abstract Litter decomposition provides the primary source of mineral nitrogen (N) for biological activity in most terrestrial ecosystems. A 10-year decomposition experiment in 21 sites from seven biomes found that net N release from leaf litter is dominantly driven by the initial tissue N concentration and mass remaining regardless of climate, edaphic conditions, or biota. Arid grasslands exposed to high ultraviolet radiation were an exception, where net N release was insensitive to initial N. Roots released N linearly with decomposition and exhibited little net N immobilization. We suggest that fundamental constraints on decomposer physiologies lead to predictable global-scale patterns in net N release during decomposition. Litter decomposition converts the products of photosynthesis to inorganic components and stable soil organic matter. Decomposition releases more carbon (C) annually than fossil fuel combustion (1, 2), and it represents the primary source of nutrients for plants, and both nutrients and energy for microbes, over biological time scales (3, 4). This is particularly true for the supply of nitrogen (N), which lacks a notable geologic input and is commonly a limiting element to plant growth (5). Internal recycling of N from litter decomposition thus provides a key resource for ecosystem productivity. Litter decomposition is a lengthy process generally requiring years to decades for completion, and considerable N remains in litter after the initial decomposition phase (6-8). The vast majority of decomposition studies have been conducted over short time periods (C)Climatic decomposition index (CDI)Mean AT (mm)TRAE 0.38% N TNETPIRE 0.58% N TNETTHPL 0.62% N TNETACSA 0.80% N TNETQUPR 1.02% N TNETDRGL 1.98% N TNET Arid grassland 331 13.0 0.11 1490 - - - - - - Humid grassland 807 9.8 0.30 1138 3.5 3 3.9 1.75 1.6 0.25 Tundra 788 -6.0 0.09 589 9.5 7.6 6.4 2.6 1.6 0.5 Boreal forest 750 0.0 0.12 830 6.4 4 4 2.6 1.3 0.5 Coniferous forest 1840 11.2 0.27 1058 3.8 2.6 2.2 1.4 0.7 0.25 Deciduous forest 1485 8.8 0.32 1070 1.85 1.1 0.9 0.8 0.33 0.2 Tropical forest 3210 23.6 0.78 1429 0.4 0.6 0.35 0.5 0.2 0.1 CDI was the best predictor of decomposition rates globally (correlation coefficient r2 = 0.68). Leaf and root litter decomposition were slowest in the cold, dry regions, such as boreal forest and tundra, and fastest in the warm, moist tropical forests (Fig. 1). A notable exception was the rapid leaf litter decomposition rate in arid-zone perennial grasslands despite a CDI of 0.11 (Fig. 1C); these ecosystems may have been affected by ultraviolet (UV) radiation (15-17) in addition to climate.

Average mass remaining as a function of time for LIDET core leaf (n = 5 to 6 species) and root (n = 3 species) litters decomposed in 21 sites. (A) Leaf litter decomposed in forest and tundra biomes; (B) root litter decomposed in forest and tundra biomes; (C) leaf litter decomposed in humid and arid grasslands; (D) root litter decomposed in humid and arid grasslands. Each species and litter type was decomposed in replicate bags and collected at multiple time points. Results show that leaf and root litter decomposition rates generally increase as the CDI increases (Table 1). In arid grasslands, leaf litter decomposed more rapidly than expected (based on the CDI), possibly due to photodegradation. Unlike patterns in mass loss, net N immobilization and release in leaf litter were strongly controlled by initial tissue N concentrations regardless of climate, other litter quality parameters, or site characteristics. A single, continuous nonlinear regression derived from the data explained 77% of the variability in net N immobilization and release as a function of initial leaf litter N concentrations and mass remaining for all forested biomes, humid grasslands, and tundra ecosystems (Fig. 2) (18). Patterns in net N immobilization and release were clearly delineated into four categories based on the initial leaf litter N concentrations (Table 1): high N (1.98% N, Drypetes glauca), intermediate N (1.02% N, Quercus prinus), low N [0.58 to 0.80% N, Pinus resinosa (decomposed at all but four sites), Thuja plicata, Acer saccharum], and very low N (0.39% N, Triticum aestivum). Litter high in initial N content had the best fit to the equation (r2 = 0.91), although we could still explain 47% of the variation with the low-N litter that had the poorest fit. Leaf litters with intermediate to high initial N concentrations showed little or no net N immobilization, defined as the fraction of original N >1 (Fig. 2, A and B). Substantial net N release started when 1/240% of the mass was lost. The maximum fraction of original N immobilized increased as the initial N concentration decreased to low and very low levels (Fig. 2, A to D). There was also a general pattern of increased variance of the fraction of N remaining as the initial N content of the leaf litter decreased. On average, 170% of the initial N was immobilized (net) in the litter with very low initial N, and net N release occurred only after 60% of the mass had been lost.

Data are divided into litter high in initial N (A and E), intermediate initial N (B and F), low initial N (C and G), and extremely low initial N (D and H). The lines on the graphs show the best-fit model for describing the pattern of fraction of original N as a function of the initial N concentration of the litter (18). Model results match the observed data and show that net N immobilization, defined as an absolute increase in N concentration of the litter, is highest for the leaf litter with very low initial N concentration and decreases to minimal values for high initial N concentration of leaf litter. Leaf litter in arid grasslands was an exception showing no N immobilization in the low and very low N litters. These data demonstrate that fundamental constraints on microbial physiology lead to predictable patterns in net N immobilization and release during long-term decomposition. Patterns in net N immobilization and release have been shown to be related to the initial N concentration of specific leaf litters (19, 20), but these relations were thought to be dependent upon climate, other litter chemical characteristics (7), edaphic conditions (21, 22), or microbial community composition (23, 24). Theoretically the C:N ratio should dominantly control net N release during litter decomposition because microbial decomposers should only release N when their N requirements have been met. At low C:N ratios (e.g., high N concentrations), decomposers meet their N requirements directly from the litter. At higher initial C:N ratios, net immobilization typically occurs as microbes access N exogenous to the litter and convert it to microbial biomass or exoenzymes [e.g., (25)]. Immobilization of exogenous N is presumably controlled by N availability in the environment. Patterns in net N release and immobilization should thus be dependent upon the relative C:N ratios of the decomposer organisms and the substrate, as well as N availability in the environment. Here we show that leaf litter N dynamics can be predicted at broad spatial and long temporal scales based only on the initial litter N concentration and the mass remaining during decomposition. Net N release started when the average C:N ratio of the leaf litter was less than 40 (a range of 31 to 48). This is somewhat lower than in a 6-year decomposition study across Canada (C:N = 55) (22). The Canadian study used a narrower range of initial litter N and reported no relation between initial N concentration and rates of net N release. However, when net N release and immobilization are examined per unit of mass remaining, results were similar to the LIDET study. As with mass loss, there was one exception to the pattern of net N release from the LIDET study. In arid-zone perennial grasslands, leaf litters with low and very low initial N concentrations showed a linear trend of net N release with little or no net N immobilization (Fig. 2, E and F). The pattern of net N release versus mass remaining for arid grasslands could be described by an equation with no effect of initial litter N concentration (18) (Fig. 2, E to H). This contrasts with the results from humid grasslands that exhibited increasing net N immobilization as the initial N concentration of the leaf litter decreased (Fig. 2, E to H). Leaf litters decomposed faster in humid grasslands than in arid grasslands during the early stages of decomposition, but decomposition increased more rapidly in arid grasslands after the first 3 to 5 years to a level equivalent to that of deciduous forests (Fig. 1). This was surprising given that the CDI for arid grasslands is 50). Microbial decomposers in the soil may have greater access to moisture, organic matter, and mineral N than microbes involved in leaf litter decomposition at the soil surface, which would facilitate net N release during decomposition (31). Similar patterns in net N release in roots have been described for native root litter decomposed in situ in grasslands (32), temperate broadleaf forests (33), temperate conifer forests (34), and moist and humid tropical forests (35, 36).

Fraction of original root litter N remaining as a function of the litter mass remaining for Drypetes glauca root litter (A), and Andropogon gerardi and Pinus elliottii root litter (B), decomposing at the LIDET sites. Net N immobilization was minimal for decomposing root litter, with N being released as soon as decomposition of root litter starts. The equation for the DRGL roots is y = -0.0001x2 + 0.0221x + 0.0192, r2 = 0.90; the relation for the PIEL and ANGE roots is y = 0.0087x + 0.1409, r2 = 0.87. Our data show that the initial N concentration of leaf litter is a dominant driver of net N immobilization and release during long-term litter decomposition at a global scale. This occurs regardless of climate, other litter chemical properties, edaphic conditions, or soil microbial communities. Our data also show that N can be released early in decomposition from high-quality litters in environments that support low decomposition rates. The time required to initiate net N release was predicted from the initial N of the litter and the CDI across biomes, but required more site information within a given CDI. Roots generally lost N linearly with mass loss during decomposition. Because N release during decay plays a fundamental role in net ecosystem production, improved understanding of the controls on net N release during decomposition is likely to greatly improve our ability to predict terrestrial C dynamics at global and regional scales.
Abstract Plate tectonics is based on the concept of rigid lithosphere plates sliding on a mechanically weak asthenosphere. Many models assume that the weakness of the asthenosphere is related to the presence of small amounts of hydrous melts. However, the mechanism that may cause melting in the asthenosphere is not well understood. We show that the asthenosphere coincides with a zone where the water solubility in mantle minerals has a pronounced minimum. The minimum is due to a sharp decrease of water solubility in aluminous orthopyroxene with depth, whereas the water solubility in olivine continuously increases with pressure. Melting in the asthenosphere may therefore be related not to volatile enrichment but to a minimum in water solubility, which causes excess water to form a hydrous silicate melt. Earth's asthenosphere is often assumed to roughly coincide with the low-velocity zone, a layer of reduced seismic velocities and increased attenuation of seismic waves. The low-velocity zone usually begins at a depth of 60 to 80 km below the oceans and ends around 220 km (1). Below continental shields, the upper boundary is depressed to 150 km. The seismic characteristics of the low-velocity zone could be easily explained by the presence of a small fraction of partial melt as intergranular film (1, 2). Some water is required to generate such a partial melt in the mantle, as mantle temperatures at the relevant depths are below the dry melting point of peridotite but above the water-saturated solidus (3, 4). Originally, it was believed that the top of the low-velocity zone corresponds to the stability limit of hydrous phases such as phlogopite or hornblende (5, 6). However, this is unlikely because the solubility of water (and of alkalis) in nominally anhydrous mantle minerals (7-9) is so high that separate hydrous phases such as amphiboles and phlogopite are not stable in an upper mantle of pyrolite composition. If the low-velocity zone were due to partial melting, the existence of a lower boundary would be even more difficult to understand, as the geotherm remains above the water-saturated solidus with increasing depth. Moreover, it is unclear whether low degrees of partial melt in the mantle would form an intergranular film (10), as dry basaltic melts do not wet mantle minerals and therefore tend to form isolated pockets. Accordingly, alternative models have been proposed. These models (10, 11) are based on the observation that water dissolved in mantle minerals such as olivine reduces both the strength of the mineral and the seismic velocities. The boundary between lithosphere and asthenosphere may then correspond to a boundary in intracrystalline water content, with the asthenosphere being water-rich, whereas the oceanic lithosphere is depleted in water as a result of the melt extraction at mid-ocean ridges. The presence of partial melt in the asthenosphere is not required in these models. However, they cannot explain the existence of a low-velocity zone below continental shields, as the mechanism of magma production below continents is very different from that prevailing at mid-ocean ridges. All models of the low-velocity zone depend on the presence of water and its solubility in mantle minerals. The main constituents of the upper mantle are olivine and orthopyroxene (enstatite). The water solubility in both olivine and Al-free orthopyroxene is quite comparable and increases with pressure and temperature (7-9, 12). However, aluminum is known to greatly enhance water solubility in orthopyroxene, and at high Al contents, water in orthopyroxene may dominate the water budget in the mantle. Throughout Earth's upper mantle, olivine and orthopyroxene usually coexist with small amounts of an aluminous phase such as spinel or garnet. Therefore, we experimentally studied the solubility of water in aluminous MgSiO3 enstatite in equilibrium with spinel or garnet (i.e., under conditions of aluminum saturation). Experiments were carried out in an endloaded piston-cylinder apparatus. Mixtures of Mg(OH)2, Al(OH)3, and SiO2 were sealed in platinum-rhodium (Pt0.95Rh0.05) capsules together with about 20 weight % of liquid water. The stoichiometry of the starting mixture was chosen to correspond to aluminous orthopyroxene plus small amounts of olivine and spinel or garnet. In some experiments, homogeneous mixtures of the starting chemicals were used. In most experiments, however, alternating layers with low and high silica content were introduced into the capsule to reduce nucleation rates so as to grow larger crystals. In addition, some experiments were carried out with amorphous gels and liquid water as starting material. Experiments were run at 15 to 35 kbar and 800 to 1100C for a few days. After the experiments, the capsules were opened. Capsules that did not release excess water after the experiment were discarded. Perfectly clear and inclusion-free single crystals of orthopyroxene were picked from the charges, optically oriented, and doubly polished. Polarized infrared spectra (Fig. 1) were measured with a Bruker IFS 125 Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer coupled with an IRscope I microscope (tungsten source, CaF2 beam splitter, narrow-band mercury cadmium telluride detector, Al strip polarizer on KRS 5 substrate). Water contents were calculated from the infrared data with the use of the extinction coefficients of Bell et al. (13). Chemical analyses were carried out with a JEOL 8900 RL electron microprobe (15 kV, 15 nA, 120 s counting time per spot, focused beam).

Water contents (in ppm) correspond to the absorbances measured parallel to the three crystallographic axes. Bulk water contents are obtained by adding these values. Numbers in parentheses denote percentage of total water observed in each of the three directions of polarization. The spectra shown here and in Fig. 2 were obtained from the raw data by subtracting a linear baseline defined by the points at 3800 cm-1 and 2800 cm-1. The two weak features between 2800 cm-1 and 3000 cm-1 could be due to organic surface contamination. However, they persisted after repolishing and they may therefore be intrinsic to the sample. The water contents in the aluminous pyroxenes are strikingly high, reaching values close to 1 weight % at low pressures and temperatures (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Water solubilities clearly decrease with both pressure and temperature, opposite to the behavior observed for olivine and Al-free enstatite. The high water solubilities are correlated with anomalously high Al contents in the pyroxenes, which are much higher than those predicted from existing thermodynamic models and experimental calibrations (14-16). However, in previous studies, only a few experiments were carried out at the low pressures and temperatures where we observe high Al and water contents, and the water fugacity was probably not carefully controlled in all experiments. The high water contents appear to be intrinsic to the pyroxenes. The presence of foreign phases in the crystals is unlikely, because the infrared bands are strongly polarized (Fig. 1) and measurements were taken only on perfectly clear and optically inclusion-free crystals. To rule out any impurities at the submicroscopic level, we investigated several orthopyroxene crystals by transmission electron microscopy. The structure of the pyroxene crystals (Fig. 3) is undisturbed without any foreign phases or linear and planar defects. The high water contents are therefore definitively due to OH point defects in the structure. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

Experimental results on water solubility in aluminum-saturated enstatite. All experiments were carried out using an oxide-hydroxide mixture as starting material, except as noted. Number of infrared measurements refers to the numbers of different spots measured, usually on different crystals. Water contents (in ppm by weight) were calculated from the infrared data according to two different extinction coefficients, from Bell et al. (13) and from Paterson (28). Errors are one standard deviation. Water contents in atoms H per 106 Si can be obtained by multiplying by a factor of 22.3. All data reported here for a given pressure and temperature were included in the calibration of the thermodynamic model of water solubility. Solid phases detected refer to those phases that could be directly observed by x-ray diffraction or Raman spectroscopy. However, all the samples must have contained some aluminous phase, probably spinel or pyrope, as the aluminum content of the orthopyroxene was always several weight % lower than the aluminum content of the starting material. A fluid phase was always present during the experiments, as all samples released considerable amounts of water upon opening of the capsules. No evidence for melting was seen, as the run products were usually loose powders without interstitial glass.

Electron microprobe analyses suggest that most of the water is dissolved by the coupled substitution of Al3+ + H+ for Si4+ and by the substitution of Al3+ + H+ for 2 Mg2+. Both substitutions appear to occur with roughly equal abundance; that is, Al is distributed about equally among tetrahedral and octahedral sites, irrespective of water content. Both substitution mechanisms imply a molar 1:1 ratio between Al and H. This is consistent with the observation that the "excess" of aluminum in the orthopyroxenes relative to existing calibrations (14-16) roughly equals the water content, if both Al2O3 and H2O are expressed in molar fractions. The substitution mechanism was confirmed by a single-crystal x-ray diffraction structure refinement of one aluminous pyroxene containing 7500 ppm (by weight) of water. The structure refinement yielded 5% vacancies on one of the Mg sites [M2 (17)], consistent with H+ substituting for Mg2+ and a significantly enlarged polyhedral volume of one of the Si sites [Si2 (17)] of 1.6575 A 3, consistent with a substitution of Al3+ + H+ for Si4+. Structurally, the decrease in H and Al contents with increasing pressure results from the pressure destabilization of tetrahedral Al. The systematic variations in water content with pressure and temperature observed in this study (Fig. 2) suggest that the water contents represent true equilibrium solubility. This is also supported by the observation that runs with different starting materials (oxide mixture and gels) yield similar results. To describe the water solubility in orthopyroxene coexisting with olivine and an aluminous phase as a function of pressure, temperature, and water fugacity, we calibrated a model that describes the water solubility in aluminous enstatite as the sum of the water solubility in Al-free enstatite and the water solubility coupled to aluminum. The water solubility in Al-free enstatite was previously calibrated (8, 9) and can be expressed as (1) where A = 0.01354 ppm/bar, fH2O is water fugacity [calculated using the equation of state of (18)], H1bar = -4563 J/mol, V solid = 12.1 cm3/mol, R is the gas constant, P is pressure, and T is absolute temperature. The additional water solubility due to Al can then be described by (2) Note, however, that in Eq. 2 water fugacity enters as a square-root term (19) because the coupled substitution with Al yields isolated OH groups, unlike the OH pairs that result from the substitution of 2 H+ for Mg2+ in pure enstatite (8, 9). A least-squares fit of all experimental data to Eq. 2 yielded AAl = 0.042 ppm/bar0.5, H1barAl = -79,685 J/mol, and V solidAl= 11.3 cm3/mol. The total water solubility in orthopyroxene coexisting with olivine and either spinel or pyrope can now be calculated at any pressure and temperature by adding the results from Eqs. 1 and 2. This is consistent with observations from previous studies that the water solubility coupled to Al and the water solubility in Al-free enstatite are due to different and independent defects, with the bulk water solubility being the sum of the individual defect solubilities (8, 20). Only pressure and temperature are required to calculate the equilibrium water content in the Al-saturated orthopyroxene. This is because according to the phase rule, in a four-component system (MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O) the coexistence of four phases (orthopyroxene, olivine, aluminous phase, and fluid) only leaves two degrees of freedom. Therefore, if pressure and temperature are given, all compositional variables in the system are determined. Bulk mantle water solubility has a pronounced minimum (Fig. 4) between 150 and 200 km depth, coinciding with the location of the seismic low-velocity zone (shaded) below continental shields. The minimum is due to the sharp decrease of water solubility in aluminous orthopyroxene with temperature and also with pressure, whereas water solubility in olivine continuously increases with pressure and temperature (7, 12). As shown in Fig. 4, at a bulk water content of about 800 ppm, the mantle in the low-velocity zone would be oversaturated with water (i.e., the water activity would equal 1). However, as the geotherm at this depth is located above the water-saturated peridotite solidus (3, 4) of about 1000C, a hydrous melt will form in the presence of sufficient amounts of water. Because the temperature of the geotherm is far above the water-saturated solidus under these conditions, a water activity around 0.1 is probably sufficient to induce melting (21). This water activity would imply that a few hundred ppm of water are sufficient to generate a small fraction of hydrous melt in the asthenosphere. Such water contents are to be expected in the upper mantle (22-24). If the same calculation is carried out for a hotter oceanic geotherm (Fig. 4, right panel), the upper boundary of the zone of minimum water solubility is lifted to a depth of only 60 to 80 km, consistent with the position of the low-velocity zone below oceans. Moreover, this behavior also provides a straightforward explanation for the seismic observation that the top of the low-velocity zone is very sharp and well defined, whereas the lower boundary is more diffuse and difficult to locate (2, 25). As the water solubility in mantle minerals sharply increases with decreasing depth, the fraction of partial melt in equilibrium with these minerals will also sharply decrease at the asthenosphere-lithosphere boundary. On the other hand, toward the lower boundary of the asthenosphere, the decrease in melt fraction will be more gradual, reflecting the gradual increase of water solubility in olivine and orthopyroxene.

Water solubility (in ppm by weight) in upper-mantle minerals as a function of depth for a typical continental shield and oceanic geotherm (26). The typical position of the low-velocity zone (LVZ) below continental shields and below oceans is shaded in gray. Water solubility in olivine is according to Kohlstedt et al. (7). Water solubility in aluminum-saturated enstatite was calculated from Eqs. 1 and 2. Recently (27), it was suggested that the infrared extinction coefficient of water in olivine may be considerably smaller than previously thought. If this new calibration were applied, the water solubility in olivine would increase by a factor of about 2.5. This would somewhat sharpen the minimum in the bulk water solubility curves shown above and move them to higher water contents. It would not, however, change the general shape of the curves or the position of the inferred boundaries of the asthenosphere. The effect of using different experimental data for water solubility in olivine as well as the effect of changing the ratio of orthopyroxene to olivine is further discussed in (21). Our results therefore support the concept that the low-velocity zone may be related to partial melting (1, 2, 6). However, even in the absence of melting, the partitioning of water between olivine and orthopyroxene would strongly depend on depth. The high water solubilities in aluminous orthopyroxene at low pressure and temperature will effectively "dry out" olivine, and this may also contribute to a stiffening of the lithosphere. In any case, however, our results imply that the existence of an asthenosphere-and therefore of plate tectonics as we know it-is possible only in a planet with a water-bearing mantle.
Abstract A semi-empirical relation is presented that connects global sea-level rise to global mean surface temperature. It is proposed that, for time scales relevant to anthropogenic warming, the rate of sea-level rise is roughly proportional to the magnitude of warming above the temperatures of the pre-Industrial Age. This holds to good approximation for temperature and sea-level changes during the 20th century, with a proportionality constant of 3.4 millimeters/year per C. When applied to future warming scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this relationship results in a projected sea-level rise in 2100 of 0.5 to 1.4 meters above the 1990 level. Understanding global sea-level changes is a difficult physical problem, because complex mechanisms with different time scales play a role (1), including thermal expansion of water due to the uptake and penetration of heat into the oceans, input of water into the ocean from glaciers and ice sheets, and changed water storage on land. Ice sheets have the largest potential effect, because their complete melting would result in a global sea-level rise of about 70 m. Yet their dynamics are poorly understood, and the key processes that control the response of ice flow to a warming climate are not included in current ice sheet models [for example, meltwater lubrication of the ice sheet bed (2) or increased ice stream flow after the removal of buttressing ice shelves (3)]. Large uncertainties exist even in the projection of thermal expansion, and estimates of the total volume of ice in mountain glaciers and ice caps that are remote from the continental ice sheets are uncertain by a factor of two (4). Finally, there are as yet no published physically based projections of ice loss from glaciers and ice caps fringing Greenland and Antarctica. For this reason, our capability for calculating future sea-level changes in response to a given surface warming scenario with present physics-based models is very limited, and models are not able to fully reproduce the sea-level rise of recent decades. Rates of sea-level rise calculated with climate and ice sheet models are generally lower than observed rates. Since 1990, observed sea level has followed the uppermost uncertainty limit of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report (TAR), which was constructed by assuming the highest emission scenario combined with the highest climate sensitivity and adding an ad hoc amount of sea-level rise for "ice sheet uncertainty" (1). While process-based physical models of sea-level rise are not yet mature, semi-empirical models can provide a pragmatic alternative to estimate the sea-level response. This is also the approach taken for predicting tides along coasts (for example, the well-known tide tables), where the driver (tidal forces) is known, but the calculation of the sea-level response from first principles is so complex that semi-empirical relationships perform better. Likewise, with current and future sea-level rise, the driver is known [global warming (1)], but the computation of the link between the driver and the response from first principles remains elusive. Here, we will explore a semiempirical method for estimating sea-level rise. As a driver, we will use the global average near-surface air temperature, which is the standard diagnostic used to describe global warming. Figure 1 shows a schematic response to a step-function increase in temperature, after climate and sea level parameters were at equilibrium. We expect sea level to rise as the ocean takes up heat and ice starts to melt, until (asymptotically) a new equilibrium sea level is reached. Paleoclimatic data suggest that changes in the final equilibrium level may be very large: Sea level at the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, was 120 m lower than the current level, whereas global mean temperature was 4 to 7C lower (5, 6). Three million years ago, during the Pliocene, the average climate was about 2 to 3C warmer and sea level was 25 to 35 m higher (7) than today's values. These data suggest changes in sea level on the order of 10 to 30 m per C. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Schematic of the response of sea level to a temperature change. The solid line and the dashed line indicate two examples with different amplitude of temperature change. The initial rate of rise is expected to be proportional to the temperature increase (1) where H is the global mean sea level, t is time, a is the proportionality constant, T is the global mean temperature, and T0 is the previous equilibrium temperature value. The equilibration time scale is expected to be on the order of millennia. Even if the exact shape of the time evolution H(t) is not known, we can approximate it by assuming a linear increase in the early phase; the long time scales of the relevant processes give us hope that this linear approximation may be valid for a few centuries. As long as this approximation holds, the sea-level rise above the previous equilibrium state can be computed as (2) where t' is the time variable. We test this relationship with observed data sets of global sea level (8) and temperature [combined land and ocean temperatures obtained from NASA (9)] for the period 1880-2001, which is the time of overlap for both series. A highly significant correlation of global temperature and the rate of sea-level rise is found (r = 0.88, P = 1.6 * 10-8) (Fig. 2) with a slope of a = 3.4 mm/year per C. If we divide the magnitude of equilibrium sea-level changes that are suggested by paleoclimatic data (5-7) by this rate of rise, we obtain a time scale of 3000 to 9000 years, which supports the long equilibration time scale of sea-level changes.

Both temperature and sea-level curves were smoothed by computing nonlinear trend lines, with an embedding period of 15 years (14). The rate of sea-level change is the time derivative of this smoothed sea-level curve, which is shown in Fig. 3. Data were binned in 5-year averages to illustrate this correlation. The baseline temperature T0, at which sea-level rise is zero, is 0.5C below the mean temperature of the period 1951-1980. This result is consistent with proxy estimates of temperatures in the centuries preceding the modern warming (10), confirming that temperature and sea level were not far from equilibrium before this modern warming began. This is consistent with the time scale estimated above and the relatively stable climate of the Holocene (the past 10,000 years). In Fig. 3, we compare the time evolution of global mean temperature, converted to a "hindcast" rate of sea-level rise according to Eq. 1, with the observed rate of sea-level rise. This comparison shows a close correspondence of the two rates over the 20th century. Like global temperature evolution, the rate of sea-level rise increases in two major phases: before 1940 and again after about 1980. It is this figure that most clearly demonstrates the validity of Eq. 1. Accordingly, the sea level that was computed by integrating global temperature with the use of Eq. 2 is in excellent agreement with the observed sea level (Fig. 3), with differences always well below 1 cm.

(Top) Rate of sea-level rise obtained from tide gauge observations (red line, smoothed as described in the Fig. 2 legend) and computed from global mean temperature from Eq. 1 (dark blue line). The light blue band indicates the statistical error (one SD) of the simple linear prediction (15). (Bottom) Sea level relative to 1990 obtained from observations (red line, smoothed as described in the Fig. 2 legend) and computed from global mean temperature from Eq. 2 (blue line). The red squares mark the unsmoothed, annual sea-level data. We can explore the consequences of this semi-empirical relationship for future sea levels (Fig. 4), using the range of 21st century temperature scenarios of the IPCC (1) as input into Eq. 2. These scenarios, which span a range of temperature increase from 1.4 to 5.8C between 1990 and 2100, lead to a best estimate of sea-level rise of 55 to 125 cm over this period. By including the statistical error of the fit shown in Fig. 2 (one SD), the range is extended from 50 to 140 cm. These numbers are significantly higher than the model-based estimates of the IPCC for the same set of temperature scenarios, which gave a range from 21 to 70 cm (or from 9 to 88 cm, if the ad hoc term for ice sheet uncertainty is included). These semi-empirical scenarios smoothly join with the observed trend in 1990 and are in good agreement with it during the period of overlap.

The gray uncertainty range spans the range of temperature rise of 1.4 to 5.8 C, having been combined with the best statistical fit shown in Fig. 2. The dashed gray lines show the added uncertainty due to the statistical error of the fit of Fig. 2. Colored dashed lines are the individual scenarios as shown in (1); the light blue line is the A1FI scenario, and the yellow line is the B1 scenario. We checked that this analysis is robust within a wide range of embedding periods (i.e., smoothing) of the observational time series. The slope found in Fig. 2 varies between 3.2 and 3.5 mm/year per C for any embedding period between 2 and 17 years, causing only minor variations in the projected sea level. For short embedding periods (around 5 years), the rate of sea-level rise (Fig. 3, top) closely resembles that shown in (8) with large short-term fluctuations. For embedding dimensions longer than 17 years, the slope starts to decline, because the acceleration of sea-level rise since 1980 (Fig. 3) is then progressively lost by excessive smoothing. For very long embedding periods (30 years), the rate of sea-level rise becomes rather flat such as that shown in (11). The linear approximation (Eq. 1) is only a simplistic first-order approximation to a number of complex processes with different time scales. The statistical error included in Fig. 4 does not include any systematic error that arises if the linear relationship breaks down during the forecast period. We can test for this systematic error using climate models, if only for the thermal expansion component of sea-level rise that these models capture. For this test, we used the CLIMBER-3 climate model (12), which uses a simplified atmosphere model coupled to a three-dimensional general circulation ocean model with free surface (i.e., that vertically adjusts). We used a model experiment initialized from an equilibrium state of the coupled system in the year 1750 and, with historic radiative forcing, forced changes until the year 2000. After 2000, the model was forced with the IPCC A1FI scenario. The global mean temperature increases by 0.8C in the 20th century and by 5.0C from 1990 to 2100 in this experiment. Temperature and sea-level rise data from this model for the time period 1880-2000 were treated like the observational data in the analysis presented above, and graphs corresponding to Figs. 2 and 3 look similar to those derived from the observational data (figs. S1 and S2). The slope found is only 1.6 mm/year per C (i.e., half of the observed slope) because only the thermal expansion component is modeled. Using the semi-empirical relation as fitted to the period 1880-2000, we predicted the sea level for the 21st century (fig. S3). Up to the year 2075, this predicted sea level remains within 5 cm of the actual (modeled) sea level. By the year 2100, the predicted level is 51 cm whereas the actual (modeled) level is 39 cm above that of 1990 (i.e., the semi-empirical formula overpredicts sea level by 12 cm). For the continental ice component of sea-level rise, we do not have good models to test how the linear approximation performs, although the approximation is frequently used by glaciologists ("degree-days scheme"). Given the dynamical response of ice sheets observed in recent decades and their growing contribution to overall sea-level rise, this approximation may not be robust. The ice sheets may respond more strongly to temperature in the 21st century than would be suggested by a linear fit to the 20th century data, if time-lagged positive feedbacks come into play (for example, bed lubrication, loss of buttressing ice shelves, and ocean warming at the grounding line of ice streams). On the other hand, many small mountain glaciers may disappear within this century and cease to contribute to sea-level rise. It is therefore difficult to say whether the linear assumption overall leads to an over- or underestimation of future sea level. Occam's razor suggests that it is prudent to accept the linear assumption as reasonable, although it should be kept in mind that a large uncertainty exists, which is not fully captured in the range shown in Fig. 4. Regarding the lowest plausible limit to sea-level rise, a possible assumption may be that the rate shown in Fig. 3 stops increasing within a few years (although it is difficult to see a physical reason for this) and settles at a constant value of 3.5 mm/year. This implies a sea-level rise of 38 cm from 1990 to 2100. Any lower value would require that the rate of sea-level rise drops despite rising temperature, reversing the relationship found in Fig. 2. Although a full physical understanding of sea-level rise is lacking, the uncertainty in future sea-level rise is probably larger than previously estimated. A rise of over 1 m by 2100 for strong warming scenarios cannot be ruled out, because all that such a rise would require is that the linear relation of the rate of sea-level rise and temperature, which was found to be valid in the 20th century, remains valid in the 21st century. On the other hand, very low sea-level rise values as reported in the IPCC TAR now appear rather implausible in the light of the observational data. The possibility of a faster sea-level rise needs to be considered when planning adaptation measures, such as coastal defenses, or mitigation measures designed to keep future sea-level rise within certain limits [for example, the 1-m long-term limit proposed by the German Advisory Council on Global Change (13)].
Abstract The crystal structure of a putative metal-chelate-type adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter encoded by genes HI1470 and HI1471 of Haemophilus influenzae has been solved at 2.4 angstrom resolution. The permeation pathway exhibits an inward-facing conformation, in contrast to the outward-facing state previously observed for the homologous vitamin B12 importer BtuCD. Although the structures of both HI1470/1 and BtuCD have been solved in nucleotide-free states, the pairs of ABC subunits in these two structures differ by a translational shift in the plane of the membrane that coincides with a repositioning of the membrane-spanning subunits. The differences observed between these ABC transporters involve relatively modest rearrangements and may serve as structural models for inward- and outward-facing conformations relevant to the alternating access mechanism of substrate translocation. Transporters catalyze the thermodynamically unfavorable translocation of substrates against a transmembrane concentration gradient through the coupling to a second, energetically favorable process. One of the most widespread families of transporters, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) family (1-4), uses the binding and hydrolysis of ATP to power substrate translocation. ABC transporters are minimally composed of four domains, with two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two ABCs or nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) located in the cytoplasm. Although diverse with respect to physiological function and TMD architecture, ABC transporters are characterized by two highly conserved NBDs that contain critical sequence motifs for ATP binding and hydrolysis, including the P loop present in many nucleotide-binding proteins and the ABC signature or C-loop motif [Leu-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gln (LSGGQ)] that is specific to ABC transporters. These similarities suggest a common mechanism by which ABC transporters orchestrate a sequence of nucleotide- and substrate-dependent conformational changes that translocate the substrate across the membrane through interconversion of outward- and inward-facing conformations; this type of "alternating access" model has been generally found to provide a productive framework for the mechanistic characterization of transporters (5). For prokaryotic ABC transporters functioning as importers, substrate translocation is also dependent on high-affinity periplasmic-binding proteins (6) that deliver the ligand to the outward-facing state of the cognate transporter. The HI1470/1 transporter from Haemophilus influenzae belongs to the family of binding protein-dependent bacterial ABC transporters that mediate the uptake of metal-chelate species, including heme and vitamin B12 (7). Because iron is often an essential nutrient, members of this family are widely distributed throughout bacteria, including pathogenic organisms such as H. influenzae (8). The molecular architecture for this family of ABC transporters was established by the structure of BtuCD, the B12 importer from Escherichia coli (9). The transporter encoded by genes HI1470 and HI1471 of H. influenzae (10) exhibits 24 and 33% sequence identity to the ABC subunit BtuD and the membrane-spanning subunit BtuC, respectively, and was identified as a promising candidate for structural study during the original screen of homologs explored in the BtuCD analysis (9). After overexpression and purification in decylmaltoside of a histidine-tagged construct, the crystal structure of the intact, nucleotide-free HI1470/1 transporter was phased by isomorphous and multiwavelength anomalous diffraction methods and refined at 2.4 A resolution (11). The overall molecular organization of HI1470/1 (Fig. 1A) resembles that observed previously for BtuCD (9), with the functional unit consisting of two copies each of the HI1471 membrane-spanning subunits and of the HI1470 ABC subunits (Fig. 1, B and C). The root mean square deviations (RMSDs) in C positions between structurally equivalent residues in the individual subunits of HI1470/1 and BtuCD are 1/21.5 A; the corresponding RMSD after superposition of equivalent residues in all four subunits of these transporters is 2.4 A. Each pair of HI1470 or HI1471 subunits in HI1470/1 is closely related (RMSDs 1/21 A) by a rotational operation that is close to an exact two-fold axis (rotation angle 1/2180.5) passing through the center of the transporter. By means of the program HOLE (12), an evaluation of the permeation pathway that surrounds this axis reveals an important difference related to the detailed arrangement of subunits between HI1470/1 and BtuCD (Fig. 2): Although both transporters maintain a tapered pathway through the membrane-spanning subunits, the pathways open to opposite sides of the membrane, such that HI1470/1 and BtuCD adopt inward- and outward-facing conformations, respectively.

(A) The permeation pathway generated by the two HI1471 subunits is narrow at the periplasmic surface and open to the cytoplasm, which are located toward the top and bottom of the figure, respectively. (B) In contrast, the pathway for BtuC is closed at the cytoplasm and open to the periplasm. The HOLE representation of the pore surface is shown in a multicolored form that was displayed and rendered with the program VMD (33). Red, green, and blue surfaces designate regions of the permeation pathway with effective radii 1.15 A, respectively. The calculated diameters at the widest part of the pathways illustrated for HI1470/1 and BtuCD are 1/211 and 9 A, respectively. The permeation pathway in BtuCD is of sufficient size to accommodate a corrin ring but not the entire B12 molecule (9); the ligand for HI1470/1 has not been identified. Each subunit of the membrane-spanning HI1471 contains 10 transmembrane helices (Fig. 1B), packed in a similar fashion to that observed for BtuC with the N and C termini located in the cytoplasm (9). Two noteworthy aspects of the rather intricate topology of the helical arrangement are the positioning of the helix TM2 through the center of the subunit (which places TM2 in proximity to most of the other membrane-spanning helices) and the similarities in helix packing between the N- and C-terminal halves of HI1471, although with opposite polarities through the membrane. This similarity in packing is particularly evident for the sets of helices (TM2 to TM5 and TM7 to TM10) that are approximately related by a two-fold axis in the plane of the membrane (Fig. 3A). Internal symmetry of this type is rather frequently observed in channels and transporters (13). For HI1471 and BtuC, this internal symmetry extends to the construction of the permeation pathway surrounding the molecular two-fold axis (Fig. 3B). Interactions between transmembrane subunits are dominated by contacts between helices TM5 and TM10 and the extramembrane helix 5a, with residues from TM3 and TM8 lining the permeation pathway. Notably, the regular helical structures of TM3 and TM8 are maintained only to about the center of the TMD and extend in a nonhelical, irregular fashion through the remainder of the membrane (9).

With the exceptions of TM3 to TM5, the helices in the A subunits of HI1471 (cyan) and BtuC (purple) superimpose closely. In contrast, interconversion of the B subunits (to the right) between these two structures (blue and red, respectively) requires an 1/29 twist (indicated by the curved arrow) about an axis oriented in the direction shown to the right, which passes through the helical domain of the ABC subunit. (B) Stereoview of a superposition of helices TM3, TM4, TM5, TM8, TM10, and 5a in subunit A of HI1471 (cyan) and BtuC (purple), as viewed from within the permeation pathway with the molecular two-fold axis vertical. The internal symmetry-relating helices TM3 and TM8 and TM5 and TM10, as well as the irregular structures of TM3 and TM8, may be observed. The extramembrane helix 5a helps restrict the permeation pathway on the periplasmic side of HI1470/1. HI1470 (Fig. 1C) exhibits the characteristic fold that was first observed for the ABC subunit HisP (19) and subsequently observed for other members of this family. ABC subunits are organized into two domains: a highly conserved catalytic core domain containing the P loop and a structurally more diverse -helical domain with the ABC signature motif, LSGGQ. The catalytic core domain consists of two sheets (a predominantly parallel sheet containing the P loop and a smaller, antiparallel sheet) that together surround an helix (h1) extending away from the P loop. Although there are conserved elements of the -helical domain between different ABC transporters, this region in general is more variable among members of the ABC family (20), and the relative orientation of the helical and catalytic domains is sensitive to the nucleotide state (21). As with BtuCD and the drug exporter Sav1866 (22), the region of the NBD that interacts with the TMD primarily involves the Q loop in the -helical domain. The Q loop contains a conserved glutamine (Gln73 in HI1470) that participates in the binding of nucleotide to the NBD; the corresponding residue in BtuD (Gln80) was observed to interact with cyclotetravanadate that occupies the nucleotide-binding site. The Q loop has been observed to be conformationally variable, and changes in this region have been proposed to be involved in the coupling of nucleotide hydrolysis to the conformational state of the TMDs (23). Although the overall architecture of the intact HI1470/1 transporter resembles that of BtuCD, more detailed comparisons highlight differences in tertiary and quaternary arrangements between structures that may be functionally relevant. Relative to a structurally conserved core of seven helices (TM1, TM2, and TM6 to TM10) that is maintained between the TMDs of HI1471 and BtuC (Fig. 3A), three helices (TM3, TM4, and TM5) differ significantly between the two structures (Fig. 3, A and B). These differences are evident in a comparison of HI1470 and BtuC subunits based on superposition of the central TM2 helix (Fig. 3A). Among the more substantial rearrangements between the two structures is a 20 shift in the helix axis of TM5 (Fig. 3B). Because TM5 participates in the subunit-subunit interface surrounding the molecular two-fold axis, these tertiary structure changes are coupled to quaternary changes in the relative positions of the TMDs, as evidenced by the alteration in the crossing angle between helices TM5 and TM10 from -143 in BtuCD to -163 in HI1470/1. When the conserved seven-helical core is used to superimpose one BtuC subunit and one HI1471 subunit, a twist of 1/29 about an axis that is approximately normal to the molecular two-fold axis is required to superimpose the partner TMD subunits (Fig. 3A). The combination of the repositioning of helices TM3 to TM5 with the overall twist motion across the subunit-subunit interface between TMDs has substantial consequences for the permeation pathway. In HI1470/1, the change in orientation of TM5 simultaneously closes access to the periplasm while opening the pathway to the cytoplasm; in contrast, cytoplasmic access to the permeation pathway is closed in BtuCD by residues in the loop between TM4 and TM5. An important additional contribution to the periplasmic restriction in HI1470/1 is provided by the extramembrane helical element 5a immediately following TM5. The ABC subunits of both HI1470/1 and BtuCD pack together such that the P loop of one subunit opposes the signature motif of the other, in a manner originally proposed from modeling studies (24) and subsequently observed for Rad50 (25). The closed state with the most extensive interface between ABC subunits is associated with the ATP-bound form and has been structurally characterized in isolated ABC subunits (26-28) and in the intact ABC transporter Sav1866 (22). Relative to this closed state, the dimers of HI1470 and BtuD that are present in the corresponding structures of the nucleotide-free transporters each exhibit more open conformations, because the catalytic domains have opened up by rotations of 20 to 25 relative to the closed dimer of MalK, the ABC subunit of the maltose transporter (27). The HI1470 dimer arrangement most closely resembles the "semi-open" (27) or post-ATP hydrolysis, adenosine diphosphate-bound (29) forms of the MalK dimer, with RMSDs of 2.7 A between these structures for the conserved structural elements of the catalytic domains in the dimer, as compared to 4.3 A with the closed state of MalK. The similarity of the BtuD dimer to the semi-open state of MalK has been previously noted (27), although the distinctions between BtuD and the semi-open and closed states of MalK (RMSDs of 2.3 and 2.9 A) are not as clear for BtuD as for HI1470. Direct comparisons of the BtuD and HI1470 dimers further indicate that the latter has a more open conformation than the former. For example, the distance between the P loop and signature sequence on different subunits is greater in the HI1470 dimer than in BtuD, as is the separation between the signature sequences on different subunits in these two structures (Fig. 4A). Although there are important differences, this comparative analysis suggests that, despite the absence of nucleotides, the arrangement of ABC subunits observed in BtuCD more closely resembles the closed conformation than does HI1470/1.

At the bottom, one subunit from each structure is indicated by the appropriately colored C trace, whereas the trace of the second subunit from HI1470 is indicated in gray at the top. The spheres identify the P-loop and ABC sequence motifs. The closely overlapping spheres labeled with the letter "P" in each image indicate the positions of Gly43,Gly38, and Gly41 used to mark the P loops of HI1470, BtuD, and MalK, respectively; the other spheres designate the locations of Gly131, Gly129, and Gly136 denoting the ABC signature motif of these same structures. Fig. 1C highlights these same elements in the HI1470 dimer (rotated 1/260 about an axis normal to the page). Although the intersubunit spacings between the P loops within all three dimers are similar (1/235 A; black line), the separations between signature motifs within each dimer are 16, 16, and 24 A in MalK (orange), BtuD (teal), and HI1470 (green), respectively. The spacings between the P loop and signature motif in different subunits are 11, 14, and 16 A in MalK, BtuD, and HI1470, respectively. The rotation axes relating the catalytic domains of corresponding BtuD and HI1470 subunits pass near the P loops of these structures and are illustrated as black lines tilted 1/213 from the normal to the viewing direction. The locations of these axes are reflected in the similar distances between P loops in the three dimeric ABC structures, whereas separations involving the signature motifs vary more widely because these regions are farther from the rotation axes. (B) Comparison of the ABC dimers of HI1470/1 (green), BtuD (blue), and ATP-bound MalK (orange) as viewed from the membrane in the same orientation as in (A). The subunits are superimposed onto the conserved regions of the catalytic core domain of one subunit (chain C) of HI1470 (top subunit). The P loops and h1 helices are depicted as ribbons, the signature sequence and associated helix are depicted as a C trace, and the main chain atoms in the Q loop are depicted as thick bonds. Although these elements overlap in the top (superimposed) subunits, substantial variation is evident in the lower subunit, particularly the translational shift along the dimer interface between the Q loops and signature motifs of the intact HI1470 and BtuD (blue arrow). In comparison, these elements in MalK are rotated about a hinge axis in a tweezers-type motion (27) to close up the interface relative to BtuD (yellow arrow). (C) A schematic representation illustrating how rotations about local axes in each subunit, parallel to the molecular two-fold axis of the dimer, create a translational shift along the dimer interface. These rotations can consequently be coupled to a twisting motion of the associated membrane-spanning subunits to interconvert inward- and outward-facing conformations. Although a detailed mechanistic description will clearly require biochemical and structural characterization of multiple states of an ABC transporter system (including bound nucleotides, substrate, and binding protein), the observation that the permeation pathways of HI1470/1 and BtuCD are oriented in opposite directions can help identify structural elements underlying this transition. The conformational transformations relating HI1470/1 and BtuCD, although maintaining the overall two-fold molecular symmetry, do not exclusively involve rigid body movements of individual subunits (Fig. 3A). Still, the rigid body description provides a useful reference framework for this analysis; for example, when the entire HI1470/1 and BtuCD transporters are superimposed so that the two-fold axes coincide, the transformation that is calculated for the catalytic core domain of individual ABC subunits between the two structures corresponds to a rotation of 1/210 about an axis tilted 13 from the molecular two-fold axis. The rotation axis corresponding to this transformation passes near the P loop (Fig. 4A), with the consequence that the structural adjustments are relatively modest in the catalytic core domain between structures but increase with increasing distance from this region, as is particularly evident for the ABC signature sequence. When the catalytic domains of one NBD in the intact HI1470/1 transporter and one NBD in the intact BtuCD transporter are superimposed, the relative positions of the partner NBDs observed in these structures are shifted by a translation or screw component of 1/24.5 A along an axis parallel to the interface between NBDs (Fig. 4B); this translational component repositions the two NBDs in a direction perpendicular to that generated by the tweezers-type motion observed between different nucleotide states of MalK (27), which also corresponds to the hinge motion between BtuD and the closed form of MalK. Notably, the direction of this translational shift coincides with the direction of the twist motion observed between the TMDs of HI1470/1 and BtuCD (Fig. 3A). This screw component arises from the coupling of the local rotation axes relating individual NBDs in different structures to the molecular two-fold rotation, which generates a displacement along the subunit-subunit interface as the separation between NBDs varies (Fig. 4C). The linkage between NBD positioning and the twist between TMDs supports a coupling mechanism connecting the permeation pathway and nucleotide state of the transporter, where the ABCs can remain juxtaposed during the transport cycle. The structures of HI1470/1 and BtuCD demonstrate that inward- and outward-facing conformations of an importer-type ABC transporter may be accommodated with relatively little change in overall architecture. Because neither HI1470/1 nor BtuCD were crystallized in the presence of nucleotide, binding protein, or ligand, the energetic basis of the differential stabilization of alternate conformations is not obvious; one possibility is that the substitution of the native bilayer with detergent has shifted the equilibrium between inward- and outward-facing conformations. A comparable phenomenon has recently been discussed for the conformation of the voltage sensor in potassium channels (30). Lattice contacts overlapping the molecular two-fold axis of HI1470 and the periphery of BtuD could also play a role in stabilizing the observed conformations of the ABCs. Consequently, despite the differences in structures of HI1470/1 and BtuCD, it is not possible to establish the correspondence between nucleotide state and transporter conformation with certainty; however, the closer juxtaposition of ABC subunits in BtuCD relative to HI1470/1 suggests that the outward-facing conformation of the transporter corresponds to the closed (ATP) state of the NBDs, as suggested by Chen and Davidson (27) and as observed for Sav1866 by Dawson and Locher (22). A notable aspect of the switch in translocation pathways between inward- and outward-facing conformation is the packing rearrangement of helices TM3 to TM5 with respect to the remainder of the TMD. In view of the internal duplication evident in the helix packing arrangements of HI1470/1 and BtuCD, as well as other channels and transporters (13), this suggests the possibility that the internal symmetry is inherent in the mechanistic transition between inward- and outward-facing conformations. The roles of binding protein, ligand, and particularly nucleotide binding and hydrolysis in driving these conformational transitions remain crucial mechanistic issues.
Abstract Antibody class switching in activated B cells uses class switch recombination (CSR), which joins activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-dependent double-strand breaks (DSBs) within two large immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus switch (S) regions that lie up to 200 kilobases apart. To test postulated roles of S regions and AID in CSR, we generated mutant B cells in which donor S1/2 and accepter S1 regions were replaced with yeast I-SceI endonuclease sites. We found that site-specific I-SceI DSBs mediate recombinational IgH locus class switching from IgM to IgG1 without S regions or AID. We propose that CSR evolved to exploit a general DNA repair process that promotes joining of widely separated DSBs within a chromosome. During an immune response, activated B cells switch from production of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to antibody classes (IgG, IgE, or IgA) that have different immunological functions (1). In mice, immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) constant region exons (termed CH genes) lie within a chromosomal region that spans 200 kb (Fig. 1A). IgH class switching occurs by a process, termed class switch recombination (CSR), in which the IgM CH (C1/2) gene is replaced with a downstream CH gene. CSR occurs between large (1- to 12-kb), repetitive switch (S) region sequences that lie upstream of given CH genes (Fig. 1A). Gene-targeted deletion of S regions (2-4) or their replacement with non-Sregion sequences (4, 5) greatly diminishes CSR, indicating that S regions are specialized targets for CSR events. CSR requires activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) (6), which deaminates cytosine residues in DNA (1), and transcription through S regions as a means of AID access (1, 7). Certain DNA repair pathways have been coopted to process deaminated cytidines in S regions into DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (8), which are CSR intermediates (9-11). Joining of a DSB within the donor C1/2 Sregion (S1/2) to a DSB within a downstream S region completes CSR (1). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Gene targeting strategy and recombination breakpoints. (A) Genomic organization of the mouse IgH constant region locus. Black rectangles denote CH exons, and ovals denote S regions. S1/2 and S1 are about 100 kb apart. The S1a (12 kb) was first targeted by homologous recombination and replaced with outlined I-SceI cassette to generate S1/I-SceIa (fig. S1). Subsequently the 4.6-kb S1/2a was replaced with two I-SceI sites by using a targeting vector described previously (3). The two inserted I-SceI sites in the S1 region are in inverted orientation flanking 500 bp of intron from the Xpf gene. The I-SceI sites in the S1/2 region are in inverted orientation separated by a 4-bp spacer (AATT). The staggered cleavage site of I-SceI is depicted by red and blue colors. The location of the V(D)J exon at the 5' end of the IgH constant region locus is indicated. The locations of intronic (I) promoters for 1/2 and 1 from which germline transcription initiates are designated as open rectangular boxes. (B) Schematic summary of I-SceI replacements. The S1/2 and S1 regions are depicted with red and yellow ovals, respectively. The I-SceI cassettes are drawn as black solid circles in a rectangular box. Small solid triangles represent the location of DNA junctions between S1/2 and S1/I-SceIa or between S1/2/I-SceIa and S1/I-SceIa. Sequences of these junctions are shown in figs. S8 and S9. During CSR, AID introduces multiple DSBs into S regions, with some being joined between two S regions to effect CSR and others being rejoined or joined to other DSBs within the same S region to generate internal S region deletions (12). DSB response proteins, including ATM, 53BP1, and H2AX, are necessary for normal joining of CSR DSBs, potentially because they facilitate end joining (13) and/or contribute to bringing two different S regions together in a process referred to as synapsis (14, 15). S regions might function in synapsis by generating unusual structures or binding synapsis factors (16). In the V(D)J recombination process that assembles Ig variable-region V, D, and J segments to generate antibody diversity, synapsis is carried out by the RAG endonuclease that cleaves the segments (1). By analogy, AID also might function in S region synapsis, perhaps via interactions of S region-bound AID molecules and unknown cofactors (17). Alternatively, S regions may simply serve as targets for AID-generated DSBs and have no requisite downstream functions. The latter possibility leaves unanswered the question of how DSBs in donor S1/2 and acceptor downstream S regions are synapsed. To elucidate CSR synapsis mechanisms, we asked whether recombinational IgH class switching in B cells could be established without S regions or AID. Specifically, we asked whether site-specific DSBs could replace S1, or both S1/2 and S1, in mediating class switching to IgG1. To generate the DSBs, we selected the yeast I-SceI endonuclease (18), which recognizes an 18-base pair (bp) target that is rare in the mammalian genome (19) and which generates DSBs with staggered ends (Fig. 1A) (18). We used gene targeting to generate the S1/I-SceIa allele by replacing the 12-kb endogenous S1 on the a1 allele of an a1/b1 F1 embryonic stem (ES) cell line with a cassette that contained two I-SceI sites in inverted orientation flanking 500 bp of sequence (Xpf intron) that has no inherent CSR activity (Fig. 1, A and B, and fig. S1) (5). We used this strategy to mimic the internal S region deletion versus long-range CSR events that occur during normal CSR. Thus, the two I-SceI sites flanking the inert spacer allow us to estimate the frequency with which DSBs are joined at short range (500 bp) relative to the frequency at which they are joined over long range (100 kb) to S1/2 DSBs. For replacement of both S1/2 and S1, we started with ES cells harboring a S1/I-SceIa allele, deleted the 4.6-kb S1/2 region (3), and then replaced S1/2 with two I-SceI sites in inverted orientation (Fig. 1, A and B). The resulting allele, in which both S1/2 and S1 were replaced with I-SceI sites, was termed S1/2S1/I-SceIa (Fig. 1B and fig. S1). We also selected ES cells homozygous for the S1/2S1/I-SceIa allele (fig. S1B). We used targeted ES cells to generate normal splenic B cells via RAG-2-deficient blastocyst complementation (20). To assess effects of the S1 replacement, we assayed IgG1 secretion in activated mutant B cells. In normal B cells, IgG1 secretion only occurs via CSR events that place C1 in the position of C1/2. Splenocytes from wild-type F1 ES cells or F1 ES cells harboring the S1/I-SceIa allele were cultured with CD40 antibodies (anti-CD40) plus interleukin-4 (IL-4) and separately with bacterial lipopolysachride (LPS) plus IL-4, which induces transcription from a promoter upstream of S1 and, as a result, induces CSR between S1/2 and S1 (1). After stimulation, targeted and wild-type alleles were similarly transcribed (fig. S2). We used a specific antibody to measure secreted IgGa1 as an index of switching on targeted IgHa alleles. With either activation protocol, secretion of IgGa1 by the S1/I-SceIa or S1/2S1/I-SceIa F1 B cells after 6 days of activation was reduced, on average, more than 100-fold, to nearly background quantities (Fig. 2, A and B). However, infection of activated S1/I-SceIa or S1/2S1/I-SceIa B cells with a retrovirus (pMX-I-SceI) that expresses I-SceI stimulated IgGa1 secretion by 50-fold or more to quantities that, on average, were about 10 to 20% of those of wild type (Fig. 2, A and B). As a control, pMX-I-SceI infection of wild-type B cells had no obvious effect on IgGa1 switching (Fig. 2, A and B). Amounts of retroviral infection in different experiments ranged from 20 to 70% of the cells (fig. S3). Therefore, many cells in assayed populations were not exposed to pMX-I-SceI, which means that the relative efficiency of I-SceI-dependent switching to IgG1 on the targeted alleles of pMX-I-SceI-infected B cells, as compared with bona fide CSR to IgG1 on wild-type alleles, was even higher than observed.

The amount of IgGa1 secreted in the presence of pMX-I-SceI or in its absence (uninfected or pMX vector alone) is shown. Each solid circle represents the measurements for one mouse. Error bars represent standard deviation of the mean (open triangles) of two or three independent experiments, each done with cells from a different mouse. (C) ELISpot assays ELISpot measured the frequency of IgG1-producing cells in populations of homozygous S1/2S1/I-SceIa B cells stimulated with LPS, LPS and IL-4. The cells were infected with pMX vector alone or pMX-I-SceI and after 4 days plated at different dilutions. The ratio of IgG1-producing B cells to the total number of B cells was determined by staining the cells after 12 to 18 hours with antibodies against IgG1 or /. Noninfected homozygous mutant cells or homozygous mutant cells infected with pMX vector showed negligible switching to IgG1. A table summarizing the ELISpot assays on three to four different chimeras using different stimulation conditions is depicted in fig. S5. We confirmed the surprisingly high amounts of IgGa1 switchinginthe pMX-I-SceI-infected mutant B cells by several independent methods, including B cell hybridoma analyses (fig. S4), flow cytometry (fig. S3), and enzyme-linked immune spot (ELISpot) assays. ELISpot allows quantitative assessment of the frequency of antibody secreting cells at the single cell level. For these experiments, B cells homozygous for the S1/2S1/I-SceIa allele were stimulated with LPS and IL-4 or anti-CD40 and IL-4 for 4 days with or without pMX-I-SceI infection. Although we observed no IgG1 switching in uninfected S1/2S1/I-SceIa homozygous B cells, nearly 10% of pMX-I-SceI-infected cells switched to IgG1 (Fig. 2C and fig. S5). In control experiments, about 40% of similarly stimulated wild-type cells switched to IgG1 (fig. S5). Thus, switching on S region mutant alleles approached 20% of wild-type quantities, with the highest amounts appearing to correspond with the highest amounts of retroviral infection. Lastly, S1/2S1/I-SceIa homozygous B cells stimulated only with LPS showed a similar amount of IgG1 switching [about 7% (Fig. 2C and fig. S5)] as when stimulated with LPS and IL-4 or anti-CD40 and IL-4. This result is noteworthy because LPS stimulation of normal B cells does not induce transcription through the S1 region and, correspondingly, does not substantially up-regulate IgG1 switching (fig. S5) (1). To test whether the I-SceI-dependent switching to IgG1 in mutant cells required AID, we generated IgMa-producing hybridomas from S1/2S1/I-SceIa B cells. As for hybridomas from wild-type B cells, the mutant B cell hybridomas did not express detectable AID (Fig. 3A). In addition, Northern blots failed to reveal germline C1 transcripts in these hybridomas (fig. S6). We infected S1/2S1/I-SceIa hybridomas with pMX-I-SceI and performed ELISpot after 6 days. In these experiments, on average, 7% of the S1/2S1/I-SceIa hybridomas cells switchedtoIgG1 production (Fig. 3, B and C, and fig. S7), indicating that I-SceI-mediated class switching to IgG1 can be induced in the absence of AID and in the absence of readily detectable C1 locus transcripts.

(C) The results obtained from three independent experiments with hybridoma 46 cells uninfected, infected with control pMX vector, or infected with pMX-I-SceI. ND, not determined. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to characterize recombination junctions from individual S1/I-SceIa IgGa1-producing hybridomas and found S1/2 sequences fused, at various sites within S1/2, to one or the other I-SceI site (Fig. 1B and fig. S8, A and B), which along with the I-SceI dependence of these junctions confirmed that I-SceI was responsible for generating downstream acceptor DSBs. Further analyses of several junctions that used the 5' I-SceI site revealed that half had alterations of the retained 3' I-SceI site (fig. S8C), consistent with I-SceI cutting these sites with high efficiency (19, 21). All S1/2-I-SceI junctions analyzed had a high frequency of mutations (5.5 * 10-3 per base pair) within the S1/2 sequence just upstream of the junction, as expected for involvement of AID in the generation of donor S1/2 DSBs (22). In contrast, analyzed junctions had only a background frequency of mutations (1 * 10-4 per bp) in the 500-bp Xpf intron directly downstream of the 5' I-SceI site, consistent with downstream DSBs being generated by I-SceI (fig. S8, A to C). These results show that AID-induced DSBs in S1/2 can be joined to DSBs generated by other processes, in this case I-SceI, supporting the notion that such joining could be involved in generating oncogenic translocations. Lastly, we also analyzed recombination junctions from I-SceI-infected S1/2S1/I-SceIa B cell or hybridoma populations, and all fell within or in close proximity to I-SceI sites (Fig. 1B and figs. S9 and S11), confirming that I-SceI-dependent switching on S1/2S1/I-SceIa alleles involved cutting and joining of I-SceI sequences. We sought to approximate the impact of distance on ability of two separate I-SceI-mediated breaks to be joined. To do this, we assessed the frequency of short-range I-SceI-dependent deletions resulting from joining DSBs at the two I-SceI sites that flank the 500-bp XPF intron cassette of S1/2S1/I-SceIa B cell hybridomas. For this purpose, IgMa-expressing S1/2S1/I-SceIa hybridomas were infected with pMX-I-SceI retrovirus and, after 5 days, subcloned by serial dilution; short-range deletions were assessed by Southern blotting and PCR. After pMX-I-SceI infection, about 45 to 60% of S1/2S1/I-SceIa hybridoma subclones contained short-range deletions within the S1/I-SceIa cassette, with most breakpoints occurring at or near the two I-SceI sites (Fig. 4A and figs. S10 and S11). This result confirms that I-SceI cuts efficiently, because both I-SceI sites had to be cut simultaneously to form short-range joins. Assuming that all inserted I-SceI sites are similarly cut, these findings also indicate that long-range joins of I-SceI DSBs at the location of S1/2 to I-SceI DSBs 100 kb downstream at S1 [which occurred in 5 to 10% of these hybridoma clones (Fig. 3C and figs. S10 and S11)] occur at about 10 to 20% of the frequency of short-range joins between the I-SceI DSBs flanking the 500-bp spacer. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 4. A general mechanism may mediate high-frequency long-range chromosomal joins and CSR. (A) A schematic of joining events on the S1/2S1/I-SceI allele. The two sets of I-SceI sites that replace S1/2 and S1 are indicated as solid circles in open boxes with splits in the dots representing potential DSBs. Short-range (500-bp) deletions between the two I-SceI sites that replace S1 in S1/2S1/I-SceI IgMa-producing hybridomas (indicated by double arrow connecting DSBs) after infection with pMX-I-SceI was estimated to occur in 45 to 60% of the cells (fig. S10). Long-range deletions leading to class switching in the same infected hybridoma populations was estimated to occur in 5 to 10% of the cells (Fig. 3, B and C, and fig. S7). (B) A model for synapsis of AID-generated DSBs between two S regions during CSR that relies on a general DNA synapsis mechanism that leads to a high relative frequency of long-range (up to 200 kb) versus short-range joining or rejoining of DSBs within a chromosome. We find that AID-initiated DSBs within S1/2- or I-SceI-mediated breaks at the site of S1/2 frequently locate and join to I-SceI-generated DSBs 100 kb downstream at the normal S1 site. Frequencies of resultant I-Sce-I-mediated switching to IgG1 were at least 5 to 10% of bona fide IgG1 switching mediated by full-length S1/2 and S1. In activated B cells, CSR frequency to IgG1 is proportional to length of the repetitive S1 sequence (23). In this regard, I-SceI sites inserted in place of S1/2 and S1 mediate switching to IgG1 at about the frequency of an allele containing a full-length (4.6-kb) S1/2 and a 1-kb S1 (23). This frequency of switching approaches that of normal CSR to some other IgG isotypes, which ranges from 20 to 50% that of IgG1 (3). Moreover, the frequency of long-range joins between two I-SceI DSBs in the IgH locus is three to four orders of magnitude greater than that for joining I-SceI DSBs on different chromosomes (19, 21). Therefore, our studies reveal an unanticipated process that leads to frequent joining of widely separated IgH locus DSBs. Although we do not rule out roles for AID or normal S regions in enhancing joining of AID-initiated DSBs, we conclude that substantial IgH class switching resulting from joining two widely separated I-SceI DSBs requires neither AID nor S regions. What processes promote synapsis of widely separated IgH locus DSBs? One candidate is B cell-specific higher-order IgH locus structural features, perhaps related to germline CH transcription, that could influence interactions of DSBs in certain locations (1, 7). However, we find similar amounts of I-SceI-dependent switching to IgG1 in LPS-activated B cells and IgM-producing hybridomas that have not up-regulated transcription of or CSR to the C1 locus. This finding indicates that synapsis of I-SceI DSBs does not require the processes that direct CSR to a particular CH gene and suggests a potential role for more general mechanisms. In yeast and mammalian cells, widely separated DSBs can be brought together before repair (24, 25). In this regard, activated DSB response proteins, such as -H2AX, form foci that spread over chromatin regions up to a megabase flanking DSBs (26), and these proteins have been implicated in S region synapsis (14). Therefore, an attractive possibility is that simultaneous DSBs within the several-hundred-kb CH portion of the IgH locus might generate overlapping domains of activated DSB response factors that promote synapsis and long-range joining, potentially as a by-product of a general mechanism that evolved to prevent translocations (13). Such a mechanism might also contribute to the propensity of certain chromosomal regions to undergo deletions (27). In our model system, retrovirally introduced I-SceI frequently generates multiple DSBs within the IgH locus in activated B cells, which results either in rejoining of a DSB at a given I-SceI site, short-range deletions from joining DSBs at two proximal I-SceI sites (e.g., inserted in place of S1), or long-range deletions from joining a DSB at an I-SceI site that replaced S1/2 with a DSB at an I-SceI site that replaced S1 (Fig. 4A). This pattern is reminiscent of the fate of the multiple AID-induced DSBs in S regions (12, 28-30) (Fig. 4B). Moreover, long-range deletions occurred at an apparent frequency that was roughly 10 to 20% that of short-range deletions (Fig. 4A). Although I-SceI- and AID-generated breaks are not necessarily equivalent, these findings suggest an unanticipated aspect of the IgH CSR synapsis and joining mechanism. Specifically, we propose that the CSR evolved to ensure that the number of AID-dependent DSBs introduced into two participating S regions during the course of a given B cell's activation (3 to 4 days) is sufficiently high to yield physiological cellular amounts of CSR on the basis of a general mechanism that promotes an unexpectedly high relative proportion of long-range joining versus short-range joining or rejoining events (Fig. 4B).
Abstract Sustainable development requires the reconciliation of demands for biodiversity conservation and increased agricultural production. Assessing the impact of novel farming practices on biodiversity and ecosystem services is fundamental to this process. Using farmland birds as a model system, we present a generic risk assessment framework that accurately predicts each species' current conservation status and population growth rate associated with past changes in agriculture. We demonstrate its value by assessing the potential impact on biodiversity of two controversial land uses, genetically modified herbicide-tolerant crops and agri-environment schemes. This framework can be used to guide policy and land management decisions and to assess progress toward sustainability targets. Biodiversity and ecosystem function are inextricably linked. The case for biodiversity conservation can be argued on economic, sociocultural, and aesthetic grounds (1-3). Although biodiversity loss has occurred across all terrestrial ecosystems, many of its drivers are associated with the intensification of agriculture (4, 5). Agricultural production is set to double again by 2050 (6). Unless the foot-print of agriculture is carefully managed through sustainable development, both agricultural systems and remaining natural ecosystems will suffer further degradation, increasing the proportion of the world's species threatened with extinction and further limiting the ecosystem services they are capable of providing (7, 8). Managing the environmental effects of agriculture requires an assessment of biodiversity risks and benefits for all new agricultural practices (4, 9). An appreciation of the ecological mechanisms that affect extinction risk is fundamental to the development of risk assessment protocols. One key factor appears to be the degree of specialization shownbyaspecies (10, 11). Specialists have narrower niche requirements and are disproportionately affected by reduced niche availability; the corollary is that generalist species are likely to be more resilient to environmental perturbation (12). We have developed a trait-based risk assessment framework capable of predicting the impact of environmental change on biodiversity and ecosystem services. We used farmland birds as a model system to which to apply this framework. In the United Kingdom, birds have already been adopted as a focus for biodiversity conservation, with an index of wild bird population trends included as one of the government's 15 headline indicators of sustainable development. This indicator, presented as the overall proportional change since 1970, can be partitioned by habitat to reveal underlying trends (13). The farmland bird index (FBI) component shows that farmland bird populations have almost halved since 1970, and it is widely accepted that these declines have been driven by agricultural intensification (14, 15). The UK government has set a public service agreement (PSA) target to reverse this long-term decline in farmland bird populations by 2020. Our framework draws on a matrix of species' ecological requirements covering components of diet, foraging habitat, and nesting habitat. The framework assumes that an agricultural change will affect a species if it leads to a change in food abundance and/or a change in nesting success. Food abundance can be altered by changes in foraging habitat availability and/or changes in food abundance in existing foraging habitats. Nesting success can be altered by changes in nesting habitat availability and/or changes in nest success in existing nesting habitats. Risk score calculation has its basis in the assumption that species with broader niches will be less vulnerable to the effects of agricultural change than species with narrower niches. Niche breadth is reflected in a species' risk score by calculating and summing the proportion of diet, foraging habitat, and nesting habitat components used by the species that are affected by an agricultural change. Higher scores are attributed to species demonstrating a greater proportion of affected requirements (16). To validate our framework, we assessed the environmental effects of six key components of agricultural intensification in the United Kingdom over the past 4 decades: the switch from spring to autumn sowing, increased agrochemical inputs, loss of noncropped habitats (i.e., land not used for growing crops), increased land drainage, the switch from hay to silage, and the increased intensity of grassland management (14, 15). We determined from the available literature whether these components had led to a reduction in the abundance or availability of each diet, foraging habitat, and nesting habitat component included in our matrix of ecological requirements. By using this matrix, we identified every species likely to have been adversely affected by any such reduction and calculated a risk score for each species. When summed across all six changes, the overall risk score for each species reflects the degree to which agricultural intensification has affected the species' ecological requirements (16). Each of these agricultural changes has occurred at a national scale, and any detrimental environmental effects are likely to have caused population-scale responses in vulnerable species. We predicted that the risk score for each species should be significantly related to its conservation status and population growth rate over the period of recent agricultural change. The conservation status of UK birds is listed as red (most threatened), amber, and green (least threatened) and is assigned according to a range of criteria covering breeding range and population trends (17). We found that risk score was significantly related to the probability of being listed in these conservation status categories (Fig. 1A) (mean score 1 SE for species on the red list was 6.6 0.8; for the amber list, 4.9 0.8; and for the green list, 2.2 0.4; ordinal logistic regression, 2 = 25.4, P 47 million in the first year (24). However, analyses of option objectives and initial uptake rates (16, 25, 26) show that the main emphasis of current agreements is on hedgerow and margin management rather than improving the environmental value of the cropped area (table S8). This disparity between the causes of farmland bird population decline and the uptake of mitigation measures, rather than scheme design per se, suggests that the ELS may not deliver its biodiversity objectives. Even if all causes of decline associated with margin and hedgerow habitats in the current agricultural landscape are countered by management agreements under ELS, our analyses suggest that the FBI will continue to decline, driven by the detrimental conditions persisting in the cropped area (Table 1 and Fig. 2). More importantly, the three models predict that the percentage of FBI species with annual population growth rates of zero or above will lie between only 37% and 53% [8/19, 10/19, and 7/19 of FBI species (table S9)]. Furthermore, several red-list species, such as skylark (Alauda arvensis) and corn bunting (Miliaria calandra), which rely solely on the cropped area of fields, are likely to continue declining at their current rate (Fig. 2). Unless greater emphasis is placed on improving the value of the cropped area for biodiversity, progress toward reversing the long-term declines in farmland birds is liable to fall short of the UK government's PSA target. This trait-based approach could have a broad range of applications in agricultural ecosystems and beyond. For example, it could be used to assess the risk of agricultural changes to pollinating insect populations and therefore pollination services. The necessary data for developing an ecological requirements matrix for many of these species, particularly in the United Kingdom and Western Europe, are readily attainable (27). Pollinator diversity is essential for sustaining this highly valued service, estimated to be worth $14 ha-1 year-1 (28), but agricultural intensification has reduced both the diversity and the abundance of native insect pollinators (27). By assessing the impact on key ecological requirements, our framework could be used to predict the response of pollinating insect populations to any proposed change and therefore facilitate the effective management of pollination services in the agricultural landscape. Our framework provides a robust basis for assessing risk, and its application to GMHT crops and agri-environmental management has important implications for policy- and decision-makers. We believe our framework can also contribute greatly to the economic evaluation of proposed agricultural changes that alter the functioning of ecosystem services through their impact on biodiversity.
Abstract A hallmark of epithelial invagination is the constriction of cells on their apical sides. During Drosophila gastrulation, apical constrictions under the control of the transcription factor Twist lead to the invagination of the mesoderm. Twist-controlled G protein signaling is involved in mediating the invagination but is not sufficient to account for the full activity of Twist. We identified a Twist target, the transmembrane protein T48, which acts in conjunction with G protein signaling to orchestrate shape changes. Together with G protein signaling, T48 recruits adherens junctions and the cytoskeletal regulator RhoGEF2 to the sites of apical constriction, ensuring rapid and intense changes in cell shape. Apical constriction of cells can contribute to the invagination of epithelia, such as during gastrulation or organogenesis, and the closure of wounds. In the Drosophila embryo, apical constrictions occur along the ventral side of the blastoderm epithelium, leading to the formation of the ventral furrow and the invagination of the mesoderm (1). Proteins necessary for the mechanics of these cell shape changes include the Rho guanosine 5'-triphosphate-exchange factor RhoGEF2 (2, 3) and a heterotrimeric G protein. Whereas RhoGEF2 is essential for furrow formation, disruption of the heterotrimeric G protein, such as by loss of its subunit Concertina (Cta), leads to a delay but no lasting defects in mesoderm morphogenesis (4, 5). These maternally supplied proteins must be activated under the control of the zygotic genome in the embryo. Twist is the zygotic transcriptional activator that is essential for the cell shape changes that produce the ventral furrow. One of its targets is the transcriptional repressor Snail, which is also essential for mesodermal morphogenesis (6). However, the cell biological events responsible for the cell shape changes must ultimately be regulated by targets that are not transcription factors. Of the known Twist targets, only one, folded gastrulation (fog), is involved in mediating shape changes. Mutants in fog, which codes for a secreted peptide (7, 8), show the same defects as embryos lacking Cta. Fog is therefore thought to act in the same pathway as Cta, which we refer to as Fog/Cta signaling. Fog/Cta signaling is thought to cause changes in the actin cytoskeleton in conjunction with RhoGEF2. Recruitment of myosin from basal to apical in constricting ventral cells is partly dependent on Fog/Cta and absolutely dependent on RhoGEF2 (8, 9). Furthermore, the mammalian homologs of RhoGEF2 and Cta interact (10). Finally, binding of Drosophila RhoGEF2 to microtubules by means of EB1 is disrupted by activated Cta (11). Given that myosin recruitment and apical constriction are reduced but not abolished in the absence of Fog/Cta (8), there must be other factors regulated by Twist that explain its effects on apical constriction. In a screen for genes that mediate the zygotic control of gastrulation (12), we found the region uncovered by the chromosomal deficiency Df(3R)TlP to be necessary for the proper formation of the ventral furrow (fig. S1). Phenotypic analysis and molecular mapping of a set of overlapping deficiencies (table S1) identified the gene T48 as being responsible for the defects seen in Df(3R)TlP [supporting online material (SOM) text and Fig. 1, A and B]. T48 is expressed in the mesoderm (Fig. 1C) under control of Twist (13, 14). It codes for a predicted protein with a signal peptide and a potential transmembrane domain. When an internally hemagglutinin-tagged T48 protein (T48HA) was expressed in embryos, it localized at the peripheries of blastoderm cells, consistent with a close association with or insertion into the plasma membrane (Fig. 1D). Optical cross-sections showed that T48HA is targeted to the apical membrane (Fig. 1, E and F). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Characterization of T48.

S4 and S5 for statistical and graphic evaluation.) No other structural motifs are recognizable in the protein. However, the C-terminal amino acid sequence -Ile-Thr-Thr-Glu-Leu (-ITTEL) conforms to the class I consensus for peptides that interact with PDZ domains. T48 has no obvious human ortholog but shows some similarity to the intracellular part of Fras1 (15), which also has a PDZ-binding motif. To find candidates for PDZ domains that might interact with T48, we analyzed the putative PDZ-binding sequence with an algorithm designed to determine the PDZ domains that show the optimal fit for any given peptide (16, 17). Of the predicted interactors (table S2), RhoGEF2 was particularly interesting in view of its role in ventral furrow formation (2, 3). Furthermore, the mammalian ortholog of RhoGEF2 has been shown to bind to Plexin-B1 by means of a PDZ-binding motif (-Val-Thr-Asp-Leu) very similar to that of T48 (18). We tested whether the C terminus of T48 is indeed able to interact with RhoGEF2. A 35S-labeled C-terminal peptide of T48 preferentially coprecipitated with the PDZ domain of RhoGEF2 rather than those of other PDZ domain-containing proteins, in contrast to Crumbs, which was used as a control and which preferentially coprecipitated with PDZ domains from its physiological interaction partner Stardust, as well as Bazooka (Fig. 1G). In Schneider S2 cells, a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged RhoGEF2 PDZ domain or full-length RhoGEF2 was localized in the cytoplasm or formed intracellular aggregates (Fig. 1H) when expressed alone, but localized to the plasma membrane when coexpressed with T48 (Fig. 1I and figs. S4 and S5). In both assays, the interaction required the presence of the -ITTEL motif and was not seen with other PDZ domains (Fig. 1, J to M). Thus, T48 interacts with RhoGEF2 by means of its PDZ-binding motif and is able to enrich RhoGEF2 to the plasma membrane. To understand the function of T48 during gastrulation, we studied the subcellular localization of RhoGEF2 and its dependence on T48 in the developing embryo. Before gastrulation, the apical surfaces of the blastoderm epithelium are dome shaped and the developing adherens junctions are located subapically. RhoGEF2 is associated with the basally located furrow canals, whereas Armadillo is found just below this site and at a subapical position of the lateral cell membranes (Fig. 2, A to C) (19, 20).

[(K) and (L)] Adherens junctions are apical throughout the mesoderm, including nonconstricting cells (arrowhead). (M to Q) Stage 6 T48- mutant embryos (17) show reduced apical localization of RhoGEF2 [(N) and (Q)]. Armadillo relocalization and apical flattening occur [(O), arrowhead], but apical constriction is delayed. Black-and-white fluorescence images were color-inverted in Photoshop. After cellularization was completed, these distributions changed specifically in ventral cells (Fig. 2, B to E). Even before morphological changes occurred, RhoGEF2 and Armadillo disappeared from the basal ends (Fig. 2, A to C and F). Subsequently, Armadillo disappeared from its subapical site and accumulated apically (8) (Fig. 2, D and G). A weak association of RhoGEF2 with the apical plasma membrane was seen at this stage (Fig. 2, E and G). As cells began to flatten apically, high levels of both RhoGEF2 and Armadillo accumulated apically (8, 20) (Fig. 2, H to L). Although they concentrated in the same region of the cell, Armadillo was restricted to the cell junctions, whereas RhoGEF2 was often more enriched between these sites (Fig. 2J). Notably, movement of the adherens junctions occurred not only in constricting cells but also in the more lateral mesodermal cells that flattened and became stretched on their apical sides (Fig. 2K). To examine whether these processes depend on T48, we stained stage-selected T48 mutant embryos (17). Loss of RhoGEF2 and Armadillo from the basal side was unaffected in these embryos (Fig. 2, M and N), as was the apical concentration of Armadillo. The cells flattened apically (Fig. 2O) and lengthened, but the absence of constrictions resulted in a thick placode rather than an indentation (Fig. 2, P and Q). Localization of RhoGEF2 to the apical membrane was slightly delayed and possibly reduced (Fig. 2, N and Q). T48 therefore contributes to but is not essential for the recruitment of RhoGEF2 to the apical membrane. This is consistent with the observation that furrow formation is not completely abolished, but only delayed or weakened. We therefore examined other mechanisms that might participate in RhoGEF2 localization. As in the case of T48, mutations in the Fog/Cta pathway delay but do not abolish apical constriction and furrow formation (4, 7). We therefore considered whether Fog/Cta signaling might cooperate with T48 to recruit RhoGEF2. In embryos lacking Cta, the recruitment of RhoGEF2 was weakened (Fig. 3B). Combining mutations in cta and T48 resulted in much more notable effects (Fig. 3D). These cta,T48 embryos failed to make a furrow; the lack of apical constrictions was mirrored by a failure to accumulate RhoGEF2 apically (Fig. 3 and fig. S6). Thus, T48 and Fog/Cta signaling act in parallel to concentrate RhoGEF2 apically. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

We also observed severe defects in the behavior of the adherens junctions in the double-mutant embryos. Armadillo staining disappeared from its tight subapical localization but did not reaccumulate apically (Fig. 3C and fig. S6). Thus, movement of the junctions is not simply mediated by a tensile force from the constricting actin cytoskeleton-an independent step of at least partial disassembly must occur. We speculated that this might be controlled by Snail, which regulates the disassembly of cell junctions in vertebrates. We found that the disassembly of Armadillo from the subapical position was indeed blocked in snail (but not in twist) mutant embryos (Fig. 3, E and G). Thus, Snail acts in parallel to Twist to direct the disassembly of subapical junctions, a process to which currently unknown Twist targets may also contribute (SOM text). Having observed that T48 and Fog/Cta activation are required for the apical localization of RhoGEF2 and Armadillo, we tested whether T48, like Fog/Cta signaling, was able to trigger their relocalization in other cells. Ubiquitous expression of T48 in the embryo led to a concentration of RhoGEF2 at the apical membranes of lateral cells (compare Fig. 4, A and B; fig. S7). Armadillo localization in ectodermal cells was no longer restricted to a distinct subapical domain but extended to the apical end of the lateral membranes in many cells. When T48 was coexpressed with activated Cta, this effect was slightly enhanced, and some embryos showed morphological defects (fig. S7).

(D) Genetic hierarchy of the genes acting downstream of Twist in regulating adherens junctions and cytoskeletal rearrangements. With T48, we found a missing factor in the control cascade from transcriptional regulation by Twist to the cell biological mediators of furrow morphogenesis (Fig. 4, C and D). Two Twist targets, Fog and T48, appear to act in separate pathways that converge on RhoGEF2, which integrates the signal to activate myosin and modify the actin cytoskeleton (8, 9). Our model shows the maternally supplied RhoGEF2 as largely attached to microtubules by means of EB1 (11). The onset of Twist expression has two effects. Fog is synthesized, which triggers the activation of Cta. This in turn releases RhoGEF2 from the microtubules that, by analogy to its vertebrate homologs, may bind to Cta through its RGS domain (10), allowing some myosin activation and constriction. In parallel, T48 is synthesized and targeted to the apical membrane, where it acts to concentrate RhoGEF2 through its PDZ-binding motif. In the absence of Fog-mediated displacement of RhoGEF2 from EB1, T48 can probably still recruit sufficient freely diffusible RhoGEF2 to allow slow constriction. Only when both mechanisms fail are the downstream events of constriction and junction reassembly abolished completely. The utilization of G12/13 proteins and a microtubule-bound RhoGEF have also been reported in vertebrate gastrulation (21, 22). The absence of an obvious homolog of T48 in vertebrates might suggest that this element of the control mechanism is unique to Drosophila gastrulation. However, the PDZ-binding motif in Plexin-B1 is similar to that of T48 and acts during neuronal growth cone remodeling by recruiting PDZ-RhoGEF (18). Therefore, this mechanism of controlling cell shape may operate in a variety of systems.
Abstract Many limb movements are composed of alternating flexions and extensions. However, the underlying spinal network mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we show that the intensity of synaptic excitation and inhibition in limb motoneurons varies in phase rather than out of phase during rhythmic scratchlike network activity in the turtle. Inhibition and excitation peak with the total neuron conductance during the depolarizing waves of scratch episodes. Furthermore, spike activity is driven by depolarizing synaptic transients rather than pacemaker properties. These findings show that balanced excitation and inhibition and irregular firing are fundamental motifs in certain spinal network functions. The prevailing half-center model for rhythm-generating motor circuits in the spinal cord proposes that excitatory interneurons in each half-center drive agonist motoneurons and interneurons, which in turn inhibit motoneurons and interneurons in the antagonist half-center (1-5). This reciprocal arrangement predicts half-center neurons to be excited and inhibited in alternation during rhythmic network activity. Temporally segregated excitation and inhibition would permit spinal motor networks to operate at low intensity of synaptic activity (fig. S1). Low conductance would facilitate the contribution of the intrinsic response properties of postsynaptic neurons to cell and network dynamics (6-9). We tested these predictions directly by intracellular recordings from motoneurons during scratchlike network activity in an isolated carapace-spinal cord preparation from adult turtles. Stereotypical episodes of scratchlike network activity can be evoked by mechanical sensory stimulation in the isolated carapace-spinal cord preparation from adult turtles (10-12). To probe the neuronal organization of functional network activity, we first examined the origin of the periodic high-conductance state reported in motoneurons during scratch episodes (12). The periodic nerve activity recorded in parallel from the ipsilateral hip flexor nerve (Fig. 1A) served as reference for optimal temporal alignment of scratch episodes (13). The membrane potential Vm was recorded intracellularly from motoneurons (Fig. 1B) at different levels of holding current during successive scratch episodes (shown smoothed in Fig. 1C). With the simplifying assumptions proposed by Borg-Graham et al. (14), the average total conductance (Gtotal) and the underlying average excitatory and inhibitory conductances (Ge and Gi) were estimated from smoothened, aligned records as illustrated in Fig. 1E [see (13-16)]. In the cell illustrated and in all cells examined (n = 16), not only Gtotal but also Ge and Gi peaked with each depolarizing wave during scratch episodes (Fig. 1, C and D). The increases in normalized inhibitory and excitatory conductances were closely correlated (R = 0.86, P phase lag for successive episodes (Fig. 1G for the cell in Fig. 1, A to D, and Fig. 1H for all 157 episodes in 16 cells). Nonsynaptic K+ conductance recruited during depolarizing waves would contribute to the increased Gi (16, 17). This was not a major factor, however, because high-conductance states and the coherence between Ge and Gi remained in 13 additional motoneurons in which spiking was eliminated and K+ conductance was reduced by using recording electrodes containing QX314 and CsCl (Fig. 1I and fig. S2). The remaining explanation is that there is strong inhibitory synaptic activity during the depolarizing phase of the scratch. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

Blue arrows represent single trials, and red arrows the trial average, for a single cell (G), weighted average for all cells (H), and weighted average for cells in which voltage-sensitive conductances were reduced by QX314 and Cs+ in recording electrodes (I). To investigate this possibility, local inhibition was reduced pharmacologically (Fig. 2). Both amplitude and duration of the depolarizing waves increased when inhibitory synaptic input to the recorded motoneuron was reduced by addition of the glycine receptor blocker strychnine (0.1 mM) to the superfusate (Fig. 2) (n = 5). This shows that the depolarizing waves during scratching are limited by ongoing synaptic inhibition. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2. Depolarizing waves enhanced by local reduction in inhibition. (A) Depolarizing waves in motoneuron (blue) enhanced by reduced inhibition during superfusion with strychnine (red). (B) Single wave highlighted. Balanced increase in excitation and inhibition perturbs the regular firing mediated by intrinsic response properties (18, 19). We therefore investigated the relative role of synaptic and intrinsic conductances on the firing pattern during depolarizing waves of scratching. First, the regular firing in motoneurons, induced by a steady depolarizing current in the absence of network activity (purple in Fig. 3A), is largely determined by the intrinsic response properties. Successive action potentials (APs) are connected by the smooth voltage trajectory produced by spike after-hyperpolarizations (20). In contrast, firing is highly irregular during the depolarizing waves of scratch episodes (Fig. 3A, blue trace; coefficient of variation range, 0.43 to 1.2, n =6), and the membrane potential undergoes rapid fluctuations between spikes (blue trace in Fig. 3A; see also Fig. 4 and fig. S3). Spike-triggered averaging revealed that APs during irregular firing are preceded by a brief depolarizing transient arising from a flat average voltage trajectory (Fig. 3B, blue; n = 7; see also fig. S3) in contrast to the smoothly depolarizing pacemaker potential during regular firing (purple). Thus, irregular firing is induced by depolarizing synaptic transients in the high-conductance state during network activity. A possible source of these transients is a high incidence of uncorrelated excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events (19, 21). We tested the sensitivity of irregular firing during scratch episodes to successive reductions in synaptic inhibition and synaptic excitation (Fig. 3, C to E).

(Middle trace) Gtotal obtained as in Fig. 1C. (Lower trace) The integrated 25- to 80-Hz band power spectrum of the subthreshold membrane potential. Our conclusion, that motoneurons are driven by a balanced increase in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity, is supported by previous theoretical and experimental findings in other systems. The balanced state hampers regular firing by increasing conductance and promotes irregular firing by increasing fluctuations in membrane potential (21, 23-25). In turtle motoneurons, regular firing driven by intrinsic response properties is severely obstructed by a conductance increase of the magnitude observed during the depolarizing waves of scratch episodes (12). At the same time, however, the 2- to 5-fold increase in conductance that brings the membrane potential near threshold for action potentials is associated with a parallel increase in the amplitude and frequency of voltage fluctuations and a more than 20-fold increase in integrated power spectrum in the 25- 80-Hz band (Fig. 4) (26). The broad spectral content associated with the rhythmic activity is fully in line with predictions for a state of intense and balanced inhibitory and excitatory synaptic activity (16, 19, 21, 24) and orders of magnitude higher than expected for channel noise (27). The parallel increase in conductance and fluctuations in membrane potential during depolarizing waves, observed in all experiments analyzed (n = 5), is incompatible with high-conductance states mediated by a slow intrinsic conductance change. The spinal network studied here shares several properties with the balanced state in mathematical models of large-scale random networks of inhibitory and excitatory neurons (28, 29). Although the overall motor nerve activity showed little variation in successive scratch episodes, the pattern of impulse activity in individual motoneurons did (fig. S5) (n = 10). The raster plots of the spikes generated in a motoneuron during seven consecutive trials showed no relation between number and timing of APs during depolarizing waves within the same trial or between successive trials (Fano factor 1/21) (see fig. S5). This suggests that the scratch network in the spinal cord produces stereotypical motor episodes in a nondeterministic way without repeating the spike patterns of individual neurons. This is in agreement with the chaotic nature of the balanced state in mathematically modeled networks in which the activity of individual neurons is stochastic and highly sensitive to initial conditions (29). Adopting a half-center model with balanced inhibition and excitation may help us to understand the robustness of the spinal scratch generator, its sensitivity to external input, and its ability to self organize in response to transient sensory stimuli. The high-conductance state, however, sacrifices the temporal dynamics offered by models based on weakly coupled neurons with oscillatory intrinsic properties (6, 7). It remains to be seen whether high-conductance states occur throughout the scratch network or only in the motoneurons and large interneurons (12). Our study suggests that balanced states of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic activity did not evolve with higher brain function (14, 19, 23, 24, 30) but were already present with functional motor networks in the spinal cord. The straightforward functional correlate and absence of anesthetics and other drugs makes our experimental model appealing in the search for computational advantages that balanced inhibition and excitation may provide in large-scale neural networks in general.
Abstract Despite evidence pointing to a ubiquitous tendency of human minds to wander, little is known about the neural operations that support this core component of human cognition. Using both thought sampling and brain imaging, the current investigation demonstrated that mind-wandering is associated with activity in a default network of cortical regions that are active when the brain is "at rest." In addition, individuals' reports of the tendency of their minds to wander were correlated with activity in this network. What does the mind do in the absence of external demands for thought? Is it essentially blank, springing into action only when some task requires attention? Everyday experience challenges this account of mental life. In the absence of a task that requires deliberative processing, the mind generally tends to wander, flitting from one thought to the next with fluidity and ease (1, 2). Given the ubiquitous nature of this phenomenon (3), it has been suggested that mind-wandering constitutes a psychological baseline from which people depart when attention is required elsewhere and to which they return when tasks no longer require conscious supervision (4, 5). But how does the brain spontaneously produce the images, voices, thoughts, and feelings that constitute stimulus-independent thought (SIT)? We investigated whether the default network-brain regions that remain active during rest periods in functional imaging experiments (6)-is implicated in mind-wandering (7). The default network is minimally disrupted during passive sensory processing and attenuates when people engage in tasks with high central executive demand (8, 9), which matches precisely the moments when the mind is most and least likely to wander (2, 4, 5). We thus trained individuals to become proficient on tasks (10) so that their minds could wander when they performed practiced versus novel task sequences (11). Although previous research has compared brain activity during rest to that during engagement in a task (12), the present investigation assesses directly both the production of SIT and activity in the default network during tasks that allow for varying degrees of mind-wandering. Despite its regular occurrence, not all minds wander to the same degree; individuals exhibit stable differences in their propensity to produce SIT (1, 3). If regions of the default network underpin the mind's wandering, then the magnitude of neural activity in these regions should track with people's proclivity to generate SIT. Specifically, individuals who report frequent mind-wandering should exhibit greater recruitment of the default network when performing tasks that are associated with a high incidence of SIT. To investigate the relation between default network activity and mind-wandering, we first established high-incidence mind-wandering periods by training participants on blocks of verbal and visuospatial working-memory tasks (days 1 to 4), then verified that these frequent mind-wandering periods were associated with increased default network recruitment as seen with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on day 5. Finally, we related participants' patterning of default network activity to their self-reported propensity to generate SITs (13). On day 4, the proportion of sampled thoughts participants classified as SIT varied by block type (baseline, practiced, or novel), F(2, 34) = 81.49, P 0.50, P 0.50, P < 0.05, between the frequency of mind-wandering and the change in BOLD signal observed when people performed practiced relative to novel blocks. Participants' BOLD difference scores (practiced - novel) are plotted against their standardized IPI day-dreaming score. BOLD signal values for the two blocks were computed for each participant by averaging the signal in regions within 10 mm of the peak, from 4 TRs (10 s) until 10 TRs (22.5 s) after the block onset. (A) B. mPFC (BA 10; -6, 51, -9; k = 25). (B) B. precuneus and p. cingulate (BA 31, 7; -3, -45, 37; k = 72). (C) R. cingulate (BA 31; 7, -21, 51; k = 73). (D) L. insula (BA 13; -36, -16, 17; k = 10). (E) R. insula (BA 13; 47, 0, 4; k = 13). Activity is plotted on the average high-resolution anatomical image and displayed in neurological convention (left hemisphere is depicted on the left). We proposed that mind-wandering constitutes a psychological baseline that emerges when the brain is otherwise unoccupied, supported by activity in a default network of cortical regions. Results demonstrated that reductions in processing demands, that is, performing practiced versus novel sequences of otherwise identical tasks, were accompanied by increases in both the generation of SIT and activity in the default network. Furthermore, the magnitude of BOLD increases that participants exhibited as they were able to generate increasing levels of SIT was positively correlated with their self-reported daydreaming propensities. Other research provides further evidence for default network involvement in the production of SIT. First, damage to parts of the network (e.g., mPFC) is associated with "mental emptiness" and an absence of spontaneous speech and thought (15). Second, aging is associated with the development of plaques in default network regions and a corresponding reduction in SIT (16, 17). Taken together, these findings provide converging evidence for the role of the default network in mind-wandering. Of course, mind-wandering is not the only cognitive process that ensues when tasks cease to require conscious supervision. Reductions in task difficulty are also likely accompanied by qualitative changes in attention and, perhaps, the implementation of general "housekeeping" functions (18). It is likely that activity in the default network is associated with a range of cognitive functions. For example, although we interpret results from our correlational analyses as evidence that cortical regions in the default network play a general role in the production of SIT, it is possible that some of these regions mediate the meta-awareness of SIT (19), such as the insular cortices, which subserve interoception and self-awareness (20, 21), and regions of the mPFC, which are involved in self-referential mental activity (22, 23). In light of behavioral evidence suggesting that people are frequently unaware that their mind is wandering (19, 24), it may be the case that the daydream frequency scale (14) used in the current investigation assesses people's awareness of their mind's wandering rather than their propensity to engage in SIT. The purpose of the current inquiry was to explore how and when the mind generates SIT. A more intractable question, however, is why these thoughts emerge at all. What is the functional significance of a system that wanders from its current goals (25)? One possibility is that SIT enables individuals to maintain an optimal level of arousal, thereby facilitating performance on mundane tasks (4). A second possibility is that SIT-as a kind of spontaneous mental time travel-lends a sense of coherence to one's past, present, and future experiences (26-29). Finally, the mind may generate SIT not to attain some extrinsic goal (e.g., staying alert) but simply because it evolved a general ability to divide attention and to manage concurrent mental tasks. Although the thoughts the mind produces when wandering are at times useful, such instances do not prove that the mind wanders because these thoughts are adaptive; on the contrary the mind may wander simply because it can.
Abstract Cells both actively generate and sensitively react to forces through their mechanical framework, the cytoskeleton, which is a nonequilibrium composite material including polymers and motor proteins. We measured the dynamics and mechanical properties of a simple three-component model system consisting of myosin II, actin filaments, and cross-linkers. In this system, stresses arising from motor activity controlled the cytoskeletal network mechanics, increasing stiffness by a factor of nearly 100 and qualitatively changing the viscoelastic response of the network in an adenosine triphosphate-dependent manner. We present a quantitative theoretical model connecting the large-scale properties of this active gel to molecular force generation. Mechanics directly control many functions of cells, including the generation of forces, motion, and the sensing of external forces (1). The cytoskeleton is a network of semiflexible linear protein polymers (actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments) that is responsible for most of the mechanical functions of cells. It differs from common polymer materials in both the complexity of composition and the fact that the system is not at thermodynamic equilibrium. Chemical nonequilibrium drives mechanoenzymes (motor proteins) that are the force generators in cells. The cytoskeleton is thus an active material that can adapt its mechanics and perform mechanical tasks such as cell locomotion or cell division. Here, we show how nonequilibrium motor activity controls the mechanical properties of a simple three-component in vitro model cytoskeletal network. The nonequilibrium origin of this active control mechanism can be seen directly in the violation of a fundamental theorem of statistical physics, the fluctuation-dissipation (FD) theorem, which links thermal fluctuations of systems to their response to external forces. The FD theorem is a generalization of Einstein's description of Brownian motion (2). Although it is valid only in equilibrium, its possible extension to out-of-equilibrium systems such as granular materials and living cells has been debated (3-5). Prior studies in cells have suggested violations of the FD theorem (3), but this has not been directly observed. We show that an in vitro model system consisting of a cross-linked actin network with embedded force-generating myosin II motors strongly violates the FD theorem and that it does so because of the contractility of the acto-myosin system. Actin and myosin are key components in muscle contraction and cell motility (6, 7). Myosin motor domains, or heads, bind to actin filaments (F-actin) and generate force via the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), resulting in motion along the polar actin filaments. At low salt concentrations, myosin II can form multimeric bipolar structures in vitro (Fig. 1A) (8). These "minifilaments" can link different actin filaments and move these filaments relative to each other (9). In the absence of ATP, these motor complexes statically cross-link F-actin and generate bundles that can be seen in a light microscope (Fig. 1B). In the presence of ATP, minifilaments generate contractile forces that can result in actin aggregation and phase separation (Fig. 1C), a phenomenon known as superprecipitation (10). To stabilize the networks and delay the onset of superprecipitation, we used F-actin cross-linked by biotin and neutravidin. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. (A) Schematic of a bipolar myosin filament interacting with two actin filaments. Polarity of actin is indicated by the +/- signs (myosin moves toward the plus end). (B) Differential interference contrast microscopy image of bundled actin filaments at high salt concentration ([KCl] = 150 mM, actin concentration 1 mg/ml, myosin concentration 170 nM, no cross-links). As ATP depletes, thick acto-myosin bundles form without phase separation. (C) At low salt concentration ([KCl] = 50 mM), active myosin filaments result in contraction of the actin network to form dense acto-myosin aggregates (superprecipitation). Scale bars, 5 1/2m. We measured the mechanical properties of these networks by active microrheology (AMR) (11-13), in which micrometer-sized embedded probe particles are manipulated by a sinusoidally oscillated optical trap, generating a force F at frequency . The response function () is obtained from the measured probe particle displacement u(): (1) For a simple incompressible and homogeneous elastic medium, this response function is related to the shear modulus G or stiffness of the medium via a generalization of the Stokes relation (13-17) = 1/(6Ga), where a is the probe particle radius. For materials with dissipation, the displacement u and force F are not in phase, which results in a complex response function. In this case, the shear modulus is G = G' + iG", where G' is the elastic modulus and G" is the viscous modulus. For cross-linked actin (1 mg/ml) gels, we found a predominantly elastic response in which G' is much larger than G" in the range of frequencies below 100 Hz. The measured moduli are consistent both with experiments on similar actin gels (18) and with theoretical predictions for actin networks with an average distance of about 2 to 3 1/2m between cross-links (13, 19). To characterize motor-generated activity, we used passive microrheology (PMR), which consists of recording the spontaneous displacement fluctuations of a probe particle without applied forces (13-16). In an equilibrium system, only thermal forces act on the probe, and the power spectral density (2) of the displacement fluctuations u(t) is directly related to the mechanical response of the material by the FD theorem, (3) where "() is the imaginary part of the response function, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is absolute temperature. Because we can independently measure the left side of Eq. 3 with AMR and the right side with PMR, we can search for signatures of motor activity in the form of violations of the FD theorem. As a control, we first verified the FD theorem as expressed in Eq. 3 for an equilibrium sample by directly comparing "() measured with AMR and C()/2kBT measured with PMR. For cross-linked actin without myosin, the agreement with Eq. 3 is shown in Fig. 2A. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2. Mechanical response of cross-linked nonactive and active gels (actin and myosin concentrations as in Fig. 1).

Open circles and the dashed line denote cross-linked actin without myosin; solid circles and the solid line denote networks with myosin 2.5 hours after sample preparation. For up to 5 hours, " and C()/2kBT with and without myosin show good agreement, indicating that myosin activity did not yet produce observable nonequilibrium fluctuations. (B) The same as (A) but 6.8 hours after sample preparation (with myosin). Below 10 Hz, nonequilibrium fluctuations are observable as an enhancement of C()/2kBT relative to ". Active processes create additional fluctuations and are expected to make the right side of Eq. 3 larger than the left side, thus violating the FD theorem. Indirect evidence for this has been reported in cells (3). We started with experiments at 3.5 mM ATP, where motors are expected to be active. Interestingly, we saw no difference between AMR and PMR results for up to 5 hours (Fig. 2A). At longer times, however, a clear difference developed in the form of strongly enhanced fluctuations at frequencies below 10 Hz (Fig. 2B). The appearance of these nonequilibrium fluctuations after a time lag can be explained by a switching of the myosin minifilaments from a nonprocessive mode, which cannot generate forces between actin filaments, to a processive tension-generating mode. Such a transition is expected because the ratio of attached to unattached time (duty ratio) of myosin increases with decreasing ATP concentration, when motor release induced by ATP binding becomes the rate-limiting step in the chemical cycle (20). Consistent with this, the lag time increased with increasing initial ATP concentration. We also performed experiments at low ATP concentrations stabilized with an ATP regenerating system (13). At ATP concentrations below 1/260 1/2M, we observed stable active fluctuations in the gels lasting for several hours. Along with the nonequilibrium fluctuations, we saw a strong stiffening of the networks due to motor activity. This is apparent in the reduced response or compliance of the network (Fig. 3A). The shear modulus can be calculated using the generalized Stokes formula (14-17) (Fig. 3B). Here, the network stiffness increases by a factor of almost 100 depending on the ATP concentration. The stiffening of the network is related to the well-known strain stiffening response of actin gels under external stress (18, 19, 21): The contractile activity of motors results in internal tensile stresses in the actin filaments, which make the network more rigid. Unlike stiffening due to anisotropic shear stress, however, we expect that stresses induced by the motors are isotropic, which should lead to more pronounced stiffening because filaments of all orientations can participate.

(A) Spectra C()/2kBT measured with PMR at 2.5 hours (open red circles) and 9.3 hours (open blue circles) and " measured with AMR at 9.3 hours (solid blue circles) after sample preparation (initial [ATP] = 3.5 mM). In the presence of nonequilibrium activity, the response function is reduced, indicating a stiffer sample, which can be fully accounted for by prestress/tension of filaments. Theoretical predictions (13) are shown for a network with filament tension of 0.1 pN, cross-link distance lc =2.6 1/2m (green curve), and no tension with the same lc (black curve). Independently known parameters: friction coefficient = 0.00377 Pas, persistence length lp =17*10-6 m, probe radius a = 2.5 1/2m. (B) Shear modulus G'() at controlled [ATP]: green line, 1 mM ATP, same as control (black line, no myosin). Lower [ATP] stabilized below 1/260 1/2M by creatine phosphokinase (CPK): ochre line, [CPK] = 0.5 mg/ml; blue line, 50 1/2g/ml; red line, 5 1/2g/ml. The hypothesis that the observed stiffening is due to isotropically tensed filaments can be tested quantitatively by an examination of the frequency dependence of the stiffening. For relaxed actin gels, the stiffness of the networks increases with frequency in the form of a power law as G (-i)3/4 (15, 22, 23). Given the inverse relationship between response and stiffness, this is consistent with the behavior of our model system either in the absence of motors or at high ATP concentrations (Figs. 2A and 3A). With the onset of nonequilibrium activity, however, the power law changed toward a slope of 1/2, which is consistent with the prediction for filaments under tension (24). The full frequency dependence (green curve in Fig. 3A) is derived in (13). This frequency dependence also rules out another possible explanation for the observed stiffening of the network, namely an increased cross-linking of actin by inactive myosin. Cross-links alone will not change the -3/4 frequency dependence (22, 25). Thus, the increased stiffness seen in Fig. 3B is most likely the result of motor-induced tension in the network strands. Given the presence of both cross-links and myosin minifilaments in our system, we expect that the myosins generate contractile tension in actin filaments between cross-link points (Fig. 4A). We find rates on the order of a fraction of a micrometer per second in the movement of probe particles (Fig. 4B), consistent with typical rates of myosin motility. This slow buildup of strain implies quasi-static elastic deformations that include network compression. Increased filament density would imply a local reduction of the solvent/buffer, just as squeezing a sponge expels liquid. Given the stochastic binding kinetics of the myosins, the minifilaments eventually let go, which results in a fast relaxation of the network strain (Fig. 4B). The rate at which the network can relax is determined by the dissipation due to the inflow of solvent (like the swelling of a sponge). Time scales for this process are expected to be on the order of (r/3/4)2/G (15, 17), where 3/4 (1/20.3 1/2m) is the mesh size of the network and r is a typical length scale of deformation. If we take the cross-linking distance as r (1/23 1/2m), this gives a relaxation time of 1/20.1 s, which is consistent with the observed relaxation in Fig. 4B and the appearance of motor activity in Fig. 2B.

Inset: representative cross-correlation spectra [particle pairs A and B in (C)] with positive (blue) and negative (red) correlations. Negative correlations are observed only at low frequencies, where nonequilibrium behavior is apparent in Fig. 2B. To further test the hypothesis that the nonequilibrium effects we observe are due to contractile/compressive gel deformations, we also examined the correlated motions of pairs of particles within the network (Fig. 4, C and D). The observed anticorrelations in particular are not expected in equilibrium, but they are consistent with the contractile forces sketched in Fig. 4A. Thus, actin, myosin, and cross-links are sufficient to capture essential and general features of contractility and mechanical adaptation in cytoskeletal networks. These observations suggest mechanisms by which cells could rapidly modulate their stiffness by flexing their internal "muscles" without changing the density, polymerization, or bundling state of F-actin. Cells can actively adapt their elasticity to the mechanics of the extracellular matrix (26) or to an externally applied force (1), and motors could be the cause for that. From a materials perspective, this in vitro model system exhibits an active state of matter that adjusts its own mechanical stiffness via internal forces. This work can be a starting point for exploring both model systems and cells in quantitative detail, with the aim of uncovering the physical principles underlying the active regulation of the complex mechanical functions of cells.
Abstract Genetically matched pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells generated via nuclear transfer or parthenogenesis (pES cells) are a potential source of histocompatible cells and tissues for transplantation. After parthenogenetic activation of murine oocytes and interruption of meiosis I or II, we isolated and genotyped pES cells and characterized those that carried the full complement of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens of the oocyte donor. Differentiated tissues from these pES cells engrafted in immunocompetent MHC-matched mouse recipients, demonstrating that selected pES cells can serve as a source of histocompatible tissues for transplantation. Parthenogenesis entails the development of an embryo directly from an oocyte without fertilization. Many animal and plant species reproduce via parthenogenesis, but in mice, parthenogenetic embryos develop only to the early limb bud stage because mammalian embryonic development requires gene expression from the paternal genome. Parthenogenetic embryonic stem (pES) cells have been isolated from parthenogenetic blastocysts of mice and primates (1, 2). Both mouse and primate pES cells undergo extensive differentiation in vitro (2, 3), and pES cells contribute widely to adult tissues in chimeric mice (1). A human case of parthenogenetic chimerism has been described in which the hematopoietic system and skin were derived from parthenogenetic cells (4). In addition to pluripotent stem cells from fertilized embryos and embryos created by somatic-cell nuclear transfer (5), parthenogenesis is another method for creating pluripotent stem cells that might serve as a source of tissue for transplantation. Highly efficient methods of experimental murine parthenogenesis exist in which oocytes arrested at the second meiotic metaphase (MII) are chemically activated in the presence of cytochalasin, a drug that prevents extrusion of the second polar body (6). Diploidy is maintained, and the resulting pseudozygote can develop into a blastocyst from which ES cells can be isolated [which we term p(MII)ES cells (7)]. In some cases, pES cells harbor a duplication of a haploid genome and are thus believed to be predominantly homozygous (7, 8). Because tissues derived from homozygous pES cells would express only one of two sets of parental histocompatibility antigens, they can be more readily matched to patients and might pose less risk of tissue rejection (9). However, in heterozygous recipients, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) homozygous tissues may be rejected by natural killer (NK) cells that recognize the lack of one set of histocompatibility antigens, a phenomenon called "hybrid resistance" that is particularly relevant to bone marrow transplantation (10). As compared with mismatched organs, partial MHC antigen matching enhances allograft survival, but full MHC-matched tissues are the most favorable for transplant (11). The only certain strategy for avoiding immunologic complications is to transplant genetically identical tissues, but this limits transplantation to autologous tissues, transplants between monozygotic twins, or cells created by somatic cell nuclear transfer. Here we characterize pluripotent ES cell lines generated by parthenogenesis in which both of the maternal MHC loci have been maintained. Differentiated tissues from such MHC-matched ES cells can be transplanted into the oocyte donor strain without rejection, suggesting that these cells could be a favorable source of histocompatible tissues for transplantation. Recombinant MHC-matched p(MII)ES cells. We reasoned that during the isolation of p(MII)ES cells from hybrid F1 mice, recombination events occurring between paired homologous chromosomes in meiosis I would produce cells that had restored heterozygosity at the MHC loci (Fig. 1B). Recombination frequencies place the murine H-2 MHC locus at 1/218.5 centimorgans (cM) from the centromere on mouse chromosome 17 (12), thus predicting that approximately one in five meioses will yield a crossover event. We collected mature oocytes from C57BL/6 * CBA F1 mice and initiated parthenogenetic embryo development via a protocol that prevents extrusion of the second polar body. From the 74% of activated oocytes that developed to blastocysts, we isolated 72 p(MII)ES cell lines (Table 1). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

S1A, black circles; and fig. S1, B and C). Genotyping of flanking markers on chromosome 17 confirmed the MHC heterozygosity in a subset of eight selected cell lines (fig. S1C). We call ES cells selected in this manner recombinant MHC-matched p(MII)ES cells. Recombinant MHC-matched p(MII)ES cells were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EBs) for 14 days, followed by culture on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates for an additional 14 days in order to examine MHC antigen expression on a differentiated population of epithelial-like cells (14). Differentiated p(MII)ES cells that had not recombined at the MHC loci by polymorphism analysis expressed only one of the parental MHC proteins (H2Kb for C57BL/6 mice; Fig. 2B), whereas MHC-matched p(MII)ES cells that had recombined expressed both H2Kb and H2Kk on all cells (Fig. 2C). These data confirm the heterozygous genotype by MHC antigen expression. A majority of p(MII)ES cells had a normal karyotype (fig. S2A; n = 16 normal karyotypes out of 19 lines tested).

MHC-matched p(MI)ES cells. In a second method aimed at generating genetically matched pES cells from C57BL/6 * CBA F1 mice, we induced parthenogenetic development of immature oocytes while interfering with the segregation of the paired homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic metaphase (MI; Fig. 1C). This protocol has been reported to yield parthenogenetic embryos that are genetic clones of the oocyte donor by preventing segregation of the homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes (16). From the 56% of activated oocytes that developed into blastocysts, we isolated 23 ES cell lines, which we term p(MI)ES cells (Table 1). We determined the genotypes of the MHC region of the p(MI)ES cell lines by PCR amplification followed by allele-specific restriction enzyme digestion or direct sequencing of SNP loci on chromosome 17, and we observed MHC heterozygosity in 21 of 23 cell lines (fig. S1A, white circles; and fig. S3). Genotyping of flanking markers on chromosome 17 confirmed the heterozygous MHC genotype and MHC identity with the oocyte donor in 10 members of a selected set of 12 p(MI)ES cell lines (fig. S1C). MHC-matched p(MI)ES cells were differentiated for 28 days in culture as described above and examined by flow cytometry. The differentiated derivatives expressed both H2Kb and H2Kk on all cells, confirming heterozygosity of the MHC locus by surface protein expression (Fig. 2D). In seven p(MI)ES cell lines, we documented a normal diploid chromosome content by direct chromosome counting (fig. S2C). Seven p(MI)ES cell lines had 39 chromosomes, reflecting the tendency of female ES cells to lose an X chromosome (7, 15). Nine lines showed variable chromosome content. A more detailed genomic analysis that distinguishes these diploid and aneuploid classes of p(MI)ES cells is presented below. Pericentromeric genotype and patterns of recombination in p(MII) and p(MI)ES cells. To assess the pattern of chromosomal segregation observed under the different oocyte activation protocols and to determine the degree of genetic identity of the pES cells with the oocyte donor, we determined the pericentromeric genotype and distal recombination of the p(MII)ES and p(MI)ES cell lines using SNPs that distinguish the parental mouse strains (C57BL/6 and CBA) (17). We hypothesized that p(MII)ES cells would be predominantly homozygous, with recombination reflected by a telomeric predominance of heterozygous SNPs. Conversely, we reasoned that the p(MI)ES cells would be predominantly heterozygous, with recombination reflected by a telomeric predominance of homozygous SNPs. Moreover, ES cells isolated from embryos that resulted from natural fertilization events between strains of inbred mice (fES cells from F1 matings) should show heterozygosity at all loci, because the gametes derive from homozygous parents in which meiotic recombination is genetically invisible. We genotyped three SNPs on chromosome 17 in 72 p(MII)ES, 23 p(MI)ES, and 20 fES cell lines, and a single pericentrimeric SNP on each chromosome in one p(MII)ES and five p(MI)ES cell lines (fig. S4). Based on the results of this low-resolution genotyping, we selected a set of 17 p(MII)ES and 20 p(MI)ES cells and performed higher-resolution genotyping using a standard panel of 768 mouse markers evenly spaced across the genome [an expansion of a previously described SNP set (18)]. A total of 514 markers spanning the 2.25 gigabases (Gb) across the 19 autosomes were informative: They were polymorphic between C57BL/6 and CBA and had a control F1 correctly identified as heterozygous (resulting in an average intermarker distance of 4.6 Mb). SNP genotyping confirmed the hypothesized patterns of recombination but revealed a surprisingly high degree of heterozygosity for the p(MII)ES cells. Because sister chromatid segregation is prevented in MII, all chromosomes were substantially homozygous near their centromeres for one of the two parental strains (Fig. 3A and figs. S5 and S6). Because of recombination, the heterozygosity of SNP markers increased in frequency in proportion to the genetic distance from the centromere (Fig. 3A, right panel; and fig. S6A). Despite the presumption of predominant homozygosity in p(MII)ES cells, we found homozygosity at only 36.9% of loci in a survey of 17 p(MII)ES cell lines, with a range of homozygosity between 23.9 and 47.5% (fig. S7). These data demonstrate that, contrary to expectation, recombination renders the majority of loci in p(MII)ES cells heterozygous.

Left panels show genotypes for each chromosome, from centromere (cen, top) to telomere (tel, bottom), revealing blocks, or haplotypes, of markers. Green, homozygous C57BL/6 (B6) SNP; orange, homozygous CBA SNP; blue, heterozygous (HET) SNP. Right panels show the heterozygosity of SNP markers plotted against SNP marker distance from the centromere. Some p(MII)ES cells harbored genotypes that showed homozygosity of SNPs from one parental strain near the centromere, followed by a region of heterozygosity, and then a telomeric region of homozygosity of SNPs from the other parental strain (chromosomes 8 and 10 in Fig. 3A). This pattern is consistent with meiotic recombination between both sister chromatid pairs of homologous chromosomes, which occurs during MI, followed by segregation of the bivalents into separate cells upon extrusion of the first polar body, and then co-segregation of the recombinant sister chromatids into the same cell due to inhibition of extrusion of the second polar body (Fig. 1B). With both sister chromatids undergoing recombination separately, we postulated that p(MII)ES cells, although constrained to be homozygous at the centromeres, would manifest recombination at a rate that would be equivalent to an F2 intercross between two F1 mice. We calculated the genetic linkage map from the p(MII)ES genotypes using the program MAPMAKER/EXP version 3 under the model of an F2 intercross, and across all autosomes we estimated a total map length of 1329 cM. This is broadly consistent with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Whitehead map, which reported a total autosomal map length estimate of 1338 cM (19). Analysis of the recombination patterns of 20 p(MI)ES cells showed two distinct subgroups. Twelve of the p(MI)ES cells showed a predominant pattern of heterozygosity beginning at the centromere, followed on some chromosomes by telomeric regions of homozygosity (Fig. 3F and fig. S6B). When the genotype data of these 12 lines were similarly evaluated under the assumption of an F2 intercross, the observed map length was significantly suppressed (910 cM). Despite the high density of polymorphic markers examined, 94 of the 228 autosomes in these 12 lines were observed to be completely heterozygous (fig. S7). These observations drive the estimated map length down as compared to that of the p(MII)ES cells and a standard F2 recombination pattern. Indeed, the map length is suppressed because the recombinant chromosomes will in some cases co-segregate by chance (or by nondisjunction) into the same cell, thereby preserving heterozygosity in the genotyping assay (fig. S8). A subset of eight p(MI)ES cells demonstrated complete heterozygosity across all loci, suggesting genetic identity of the parthenogenetic embryo with the oocyte donor-in effect, a parthenogenetic clone, as originally reported (16). However, all of the eight p(MI)ES cell lines that show complete heterozygosity are in fact aneuploid, with a range of chromosome counts between 38 and 77. Thus we speculate that these panheterozygous p(MI)ES cells derive from tetraploid blastocysts that manifest infidelity of chromosomal segregation during derivation and culture. Indeed, when oocytes are activated soon after cytochalasin treatment to block MI, tetraploid blastocysts frequently result (figs. S2C and S9). Such embryos will yield tetraploid p(MI)ES cells, and it is possible that incubation with dimethylaminopurine may thereafter predispose them to abnormal chromosomal segregation or chromosomal loss. Such isolates maintain complete heterozygosity when genotyped as a population but do not represent a true clone of cells with genetic identity to the oocyte donor. Theoretically, parthenogenetic clones would arise only if the recombination events of MI are suppressed or if there is obligate co-segregation of the recombinant chromosomes into the same daughter cell. Based on our experience, we are skeptical that true parthenogenetic clones can be isolated. Differentiation potential of p(MII)ES and p(MI)ES cell lines. To assess the pluripotency of the MHC-matched pES cells, we evaluated their differentiation potential by in vitro and in vivo assays. We injected cells subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice and observed robust teratoma formation from multiple p(MII)ES (n = 11), p(MI)ES (n = 4), and fES (n = 3) cell lines. The differentiation potential of p(MII)ES cells has been well documented (1), but not that of p (MI)ES cells. Histology of teratomas made from p(MI)ES cells revealed tissue elements of all three embryonic germ layers: mesoderm (bone, bone marrow, muscle, and cartilage), endoderm (respiratory epithelium and exocrine pancreas), and ectoderm [brain, melanocyte (iris), and skin] (Fig. 4). Using previously published methods for in vitro differentiation of ES cells, we observed rhythmic contractility in EBs that was consistent with cardiomyocyte development in pMI, pMII, and fES cells, and comparable numbers of hematopoietic elements as measured by methylcellulose-based colony-forming cell assays and flow cytometric analysis for the hematopoietic markers c-Kit, CD41, and CD45 (20) (fig. S10, A and B). We generated chimeric mice by injecting p(MII)ES (n = 4) and p(MI)ES (n = 3) cells into recipient blastocysts. Examples of p(MII)ES and p(MI)ES cells each demonstrated fetal liver chimerism and high-level skin chimerism of adult mice (Fig. 4I). No germline transmission of gametes from the p (MII)ES or p(MI)ES cells was noted in eight matings of female chimeras that generated more than 700 progeny. Moreover, injection of over 50 tetraploid embryos with p(MI)ES cells failed to result in live births, consistent with the known developmental limitation of parthenogenetic mouse embryos (1). Although not fully competent to sustain organismal development because of a lack of paternal imprints, p(MII)ES and p(MI)ES cells appear to share a comparable degree of multilineage tissue differentiation as f ES cells.

Histocompatibility of differentiated progeny of MHC-matched p(MII) and p(MI)ES cells. To test the immune compatibility of selected ES cell lines, we performed transplantation experiments in immunodeficient mice and immunocompetent recipients that were either MHC-matched or -mismatched. When we injected 106 undifferentiated fES or pES cells subcutaneously into immunocompetent mice, we failed to observe efficient teratoma formation regardless of the genotypes of the ES cells or recipient mice. Like early embryonic tissues, undifferentiated mouse ES cells do not express MHC antigens, which we speculate renders them susceptible to rejection by NK cells (5). MHC antigens are expressed after differentiation of mouse ES cells in vitro (Fig. 2). To determine whether differentiated tissues derived from ES cells would be accepted as tissue grafts in recipient mice, we pre-differentiated ES cells into EBs for 2 weeks, then injected EB cells subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice or into immunocompetent MHC-matched and -mismatched recipients. We observed teratomas in all mice when we injected pre-differentiated ES cells into immunodeficient Rag2-/-/c-/- mice (Table 2). In immunocompetent recipient mice, we observed teratoma formation from pre-differentiated fES and pES cells only if there was no MHC mismatch with the recipient (Table 2). All ES cells that carried both C57BL/6 and CBA MHC genotypes successfully engrafted in heterozygous MHC-matched C57BL/6 * CBA F1 recipients, but failed to form teratomas in mismatched homozygous C57BL/6 or CBA recipients (Table 2). Homozygous fES or p(MII) ES cells engrafted in MHC-matched homozygous and heterozygous recipients (Table 2). Because ES cells of the CBA strain form teratomas in the Rag2-/-/c-/- mice, which are on the C57BL/6 background, we conclude that the immune response, and not host strain factors, is responsible for the failure of teratoma formation in immunocompetent MHC-mismatched recipients. These data demonstrate the histocompatibility of differentiated tissues from fES and pES cells that share genetic identity at the MHC loci with transplant recipients. Table 2.

We describe two strategies for isolating pluripotent murine ES cells that are genetically matched to the oocyte donor at the MHC loci. By applying genotyping analysis to pES cells isolated from hybrid C57BL/6 * CBA F1 mice, we have selected lines that retain the maternal MHC genotype by virtue of specific meiotic recombination events and inheritance of the relevant sister chromatids. When these genetically defined pES cells are pre-differentiated into EBs before being injected into immunocompetent recipient mice, the tissues engraft as long as the MHC genotype of the donor cells is matched to the recipient mouse. Although unable to sustain full organismal development because of the lack of paternal imprints, ES cells derived from parthenogenetic embryos appear to be pluripotent. Whether tissue differentiation and engraftment into all lineages are robust and whether the loss of heterozygosity of critical genomic regions might disrupt cell function in engrafted tissues remain central questions (21). These caveats notwithstanding, our data from the murine system establish a proof of principle for using parthenogenesis to generate MHC-matched tissues for transplantation. Differentiated tissues from pES cells that express only one of the two sets of parental MHC haplotypes appear to engraft in heterozygous recipients (for example, C57BL/6 into C57BL/6 * CBA F1 recipients; Table 2). This suggests the theoretical possibility that a modest-sized bank consisting of pES cells homozygous for the major MHC haplotypes could serve as a source of transplantable tissues for cell replacement therapy. However, bone marrow and perhaps other tissues are subject to rejection by NK cells, which can distinguish tissues that express the full complement of MHC molecules from those expressing only a few (10). Moreover, minor histocompatibility antigens scattered across the genome might complicate transplantation from an allogeneic cell bank. Full MHC matching (or indeed, full genetic identity) is most favorable for predicting the survival and function of solid-organ allografts (11). More discriminating transplantation experiments are needed to distinguish the relative merits of tissues derived from homozygous MHC-matched pES cells, fully MHC-matched pES cells, or isogenic tissues derived by nuclear transfer. A routine, highly efficient method for experimental parthenogenesis in mice interrupts MII and results in an embryo that carries a duplicated haploid genome that has been described as predominantly homozygous, except for regions that have reverted to heterozygosity because of recombination events during MI (3). Our data demonstrate quite unexpectedly that the majority of loci in p(MII)ES cells undergo recombination, thereby generating a predominantly heterozygous genome. Similarly, activation of immature oocytes and inhibition of the first meiotic division ensure that substantial heterozygosity is preserved across the genome, except for those regions that convert to homozygosity because of recombination. Both p(MII) and p(MI) cells can be selected to maintain the MHC genotype of the oocyte donor. All forms of pES cells retain the mitochondrial genome of the oocyte donor, unlike genetically matched ES cells that are created by nuclear transfer into oocytes from an unrelated donor, and therefore may avoid immunologic rejection due to antigens encoded by the mitochondrial genome (22). Using a protocol that had been reported to create parthenogenetically cloned embryos (16), we generated a set of eight p(MI)ES cells that retained complete heterozygosity at all loci, implying genetic identity with the oocyte donor. However, these cells were all either tetraploid or aneuploid, suggesting that they arose from embryos that had failed to convert to diploidy during the parthenogenetic activation of immature oocytes. Although these cells retain essentially all of the maternal chromosomes, they are not true clones and are not likely to be a trustworthy source of tissues for transplantation. The status of maternal- or paternal-specific imprint genes can be monitored to identify pES cells. Analysis of the imprinted status of the Rasgrf1 locus in 16 p(MI)ES cells confirmed the maternal pattern of methylation (fig. S11); however, the assessment of imprint loci in ES cells may be unreliable given their tendency toward epigenetic instability (23). The data presented here demonstrate that discerning the distinct patterns of homozygosity and heterozygosity in ES cell lines through SNP genotyping across the genome provides a definitive means to determine whether lines are the result of parthenogenesis, nuclear transfer, or natural fertilization. Thediagnosticpattern of ap(MII)ES celllineis pericentromeric homozygosity and increasing heterozygosity as physical and genetic distance from the centromere increases. The diagnostic pattern of a p(MI)ES cell line is pericentromeric heterozygosity and an increasing frequency of homozygosity at markers distal to the centromere. A cell line derived from an embryo produced by nuclear transfer from a somatic cell will, for the most part, be a complete genetic match of the nuclear donor, because only rare occurrences of mitotic recombination would alter the expected pattern of SNP identity. Furthermore, there should be no discernable tendency for the recombination of genetic markers at greater distances from the centromere. Similarly, an ES cell line derived from a fertilized blastocyst should be a combination of sperm and egg donor haplotypes, again with no relationship between frequency of heterozygosity of markers and distance from the centromere. Beyond demonstrating the potential for histocompatibility of parthenogenetically derived tissues, our experiments provide an analysis of genetic recombination during parthenogenetic activation and distinguish the patterns of recombination observed when karyokinesis is interrupted during meiosis I or II. Moreover, we note that isolation of p(MII)ES cells followed by SNP genotyping provides a means of genetic mapping of loci for phenotypes that can be defined through the study of ES cells.
Abstract Responsive behavior, which is intrinsic to natural systems, is becoming a key requirement for advanced artificial materials and devices, presenting a substantial scientific and engineering challenge. We designed dynamic actuation systems by integrating high-aspect-ratio silicon nanocolumns, either free-standing or substrate-attached, with a hydrogel layer. The nanocolumns were put in motion by the "muscle" of the hydrogel, which swells or contracts depending on the humidity level. This actuation resulted in a fast reversible reorientation of the nanocolumns from tilted to perpendicular to the surface. By further controlling the stress field in the hydrogel, the formation of a variety of elaborate reversibly actuated micropatterns was demonstrated. The mechanics of the actuation process have been assessed. Dynamic control over the movement and orientation of surface nanofeatures at the micron and submicron scales may have exciting applications in actuators, microfluidics, or responsive materials. Adaptive materials and devices that change properties and function in response to external stimuli are the focus of research in fields ranging from medicine and biology to chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering. A wide range of artificial responsive materials, mostly involving polymers, has been reported (1-9). Hydrogels are prominent examples of such materials. Their elastic networks swell in water, allowing one to achieve the desired degrees of polymer hydration and volume changes. A variety of gels that are responsive to humidity, pH, temperature, electric field, light, and ion strength have been designed (1-7) and patterned by means of lithography (8, 9). These responsive gels have been shown to have potential applications in microfluidics, tissue engineering, and as shape-memory materials, artificial muscles, valves, and actuators (1-9). Synthetic routes and fabrication strategies leading to new-generation, dynamically tunable materials are often inspired by biological systems that show a wide range of adaptive responses. Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated that various physicochemical properties of biological materials that are generally vital for survival arise from the presence of highly developed surface nano-roughness and exquisite nano- and microfeatures (10-12). Nano- and microstructures that develop on the surfaces of gecko feet, lotus leaves, and cicada and butterfly wings; for example, provide these organisms with exceptional adhesive, self-cleaning, water-repelling, and photonic properties. Several efforts have been made to artificially produce nanostructured surfaces in polymeric materials that mimic biological structures and functions (13, 14). The intrinsic flexibility of polymers frequently leads to undesired design outcomes, because the features in soft materials are poorly controlled in general and are often susceptible to irreversible collapse (15). We reported an alternative approach to the fabrication of nanostructured surfaces, in which regular arrays of well-defined nanostructures with feature sizes of 1/2100 to 300 nm and aspect ratios reaching 100 were formed in silicon by means of the Bosch process (16). These structures are stable and their geometry is highly controlled. This rigidity, however, makes them unsuitable for use in adaptive materials and devices. A more promising approach is to create materials based on a hard/soft combination that capitalize on the properties of both elements. Stable superhydrophobic surfaces have been fabricated by using polyelectrolyte multilayers overcoated with silica nanoparticles (17). Interesting examples of chemically, magnetically, and light-responsive photonic crystals, which were made by dispersing rigid colloidal particles into hydrogels, have been reported (18, 19). Rodlike building blocks consisting of gold and polymer domains have been shown to self-assemble into a variety of superstructures (20). We propose here to use the combination of soft and hard elements to enable reversible actuation of rigid surface nano- and microstructures that are set in motion by the polymer layer. We integrated a hydrogel (Fig. 1A) with an array of isolated, high-aspect-ratio rigid structures (AIRS) (Fig. 1B) into hydrogel-AIRS assemblies (HAIRS) (Fig. 1, C to E). The AIRS provide rigidity, structure, and precision, whereas the hydrogel provides responsive behavior. We anticipated that the combination of the two would offer substantial dynamic responses based on geometrical rearrangements of the hydrogel-actuated nanostructures.

(D) Hybrid HAIRS-1 design. The nanocolumns, embedded into the hydrogel layer grafted to the PGMA-modified confining surface, break from the original wafer upon the separation of the confining substrates and become fully transferred onto the secondary surface. The surface topography changes from an array of highly tilted to vertically oriented nanocolumns. (E) Hybrid HAIRS-2 design. The hydrogel film is attached directly to the AIRS silicon wafer. Nanocolumns remain attached to the surface and bend upon drying. To achieve these designs, the hydrogel was formed in the confinement between AIRS and a secondary substrate (Fig. 1C) (21). Polyglycidyl methacrylate (PGMA) partially modified with acrylic acid, which forms an anchoring interface that is rich in reactive epoxy groups (22), was chemisorbed on one of the substrates. A layer of polyacrylamide gel (PAAG) grafted to the substrate via PGMA was formed by photo- or thermo-initiated in situ radical copolymerization of acrylamide and N,N'-methylene-bisacrylamide as a cross-linking agent (fig. S1). The AIRS used in our experiments consisted of square arrays of vertically oriented, uniform nanocolumns with diameters d = 100 to 300 nm, heights h = 5 to 8 1/2m, aspect ratios h/d = 15 to 80, and periodicities p = 2 to 4 1/2m (Fig. 1B). We developed two hybrid architectures using either free-standing (HAIRS-1) or attached (HAIRS-2) nanocolumns. The key element of the HAIRS-1 design is the use of hydrogel-embedded silicon nanocolumns that detach from the original AIRS silicon wafer (Fig. 1D). To achieve the HAIRS-1 structure (fig. S2), the anchoring layer of chemisorbed PGMA and acrylic acid was applied to the second surface, whereas the AIRS remained unmodified. The prepolymerizate solution was introduced between AIRS and the modified confining surface. After polymerization, the two surfaces were separated by applying shear stress to the "sandwich" that resulted in the complete breaking of the columns at the base. The detached columns remained embedded in the hydrogel film grafted via PGMA to the confining surface. This procedure was followed by rinsing and drying of the hydrogel to remove unreacted monomers and the solvent, causing the contraction of the film and the associated slanting of the unattached nanocolumns (Fig. 2, A and B). The surface revealed domains with non-uniform tilt directions, conceivably induced by inhomogeneity of the hydrogel film and/or local-surface defects. The tilt angle of the columns observed in several experiments was 60 to 75, and the exposed length l was 1.5 to 2.5 1/2m. Exposure to humidity led to swelling of the hydrogel and relaxation of the drying stresses. As a result, the tilted columns moved to their original orientation perpendicular to the surface (Fig. 2C). Upon drying, the columns returned to their tilted state. By adjusting the humidity level using the humidity chamber (and thus regulating the degree of hydration and the related volume change of the hydrogel), we can control the tilt angle of the nanocolumns.

The top inset shows a zoom-in view perpendicular to the surface. The number of 200-nm bands n on the emerging portion of the nanocolumns and the length of the column projections a were monitored to determine the length l of the exposed nanocolumns (l = 200n, measured in nm) and their tilt angle (sin = a/l). The SEM of the cross section (bottom inset) clearly shows the tilted nanocolumns partially embedded into the hydrogel layer. Scale bars in insets, 2 1/2m. (B and C) Optical micrographs, imaging the same region of the HAIRS-1 system in a dry (B) and a wet (C) state, show the reorientation of the nanocolumns from a tilted to a vertical position upon the expansion of the hydrogel. Also see movies S1 and S2 and fig. S3. To measure the actuation time, the process was recorded with a high-speed video camera (21). When a water droplet is placed on a dry sample, the switching to the perpendicular orientation is extremely fast (1/260 ms). Movie S1 depicts the process slowed down by about a factor of 7. The reverse transformation to the tilted state caused by unassisted drying of the sample takes 1/24 s. Movie S2 depicts the reverse process slowed down by a factor of 2. The latter reorientation can be accelerated, if needed, by using airflow in the system and/or by increasing the temperature. The actuation cycle was repeated on the same sample more than 20 times immediately after the preparation and more than 25 times 6 months later. No deterioration or change in the response time was observed, demonstrating a remarkable stability and robustness of the designed actuation system. When the anchoring layer of chemisorbed PGMA andacrylic acidisappliedtothe AIRS substrate and the confining surface is unmodified, the hydrogel film is grafted to the nanostructured surface (fig. S2). In this HAIRS-2 design (Fig. 1E), the hydrogel-embedded nanocolumns remain attached to the original substrate and bend upon the drying of the polymer film (Fig. 3A). The actuation cycle is similar to that described for HAIRS-1: Exposure to humidity causes the hydrogel to swell and relax, thus returning the nanocolumns to their perpendicular orientation. To visualize the reorientation process and the dependence of the tilt angle on the degree of hydration and/or humidity, we placed a droplet of water on the HAIRS-2 surface and took an optical micrograph of the drying edge (Fig. 3B). The water content and the swelling of the hydrogel gradually decrease across this region, inducing a progressive increase in the tilt angles of the nanocolumns.

(B) Optical micrograph of the drying edge of the HAIRS-2 structure taken perpendicular to the surface. The clarification of the actuation mechanism is shown schematically below the micrograph. A dashed line in the schematic corresponds to the focal plane in the image. The degree of hydration or swelling of the polymer layer decreases gradually across the sample from left to right. Correspondingly, the nanocolumns gradually change their orientation from perpendicular to tilted. The whole range of the orientations is depicted, thus providing a still image of the entire reorientation process. We further capitalized on these new actuation systems by expanding their capabilities to form reversibly actuated micropatterns with complex geometries. Because the tilt direction of the nanocolumns in the HAIRS-1 design depends on the local defects on the confining surface, we anticipated that this orientation could be controlled by deliberately introducing a topographic pattern onto this surface. Indeed, a highly uniform tilt direction of the nanocolumns was achieved by using a confining surface that was patterned with lines (Fig. 4A). A variety of more complex patterns can be achieved by using an underlying substrate of corresponding topography. One such example is given in Fig. 4B, where a honeycomblike pattern on the confining surface controls the formation of a complex structure in which arrays of radially oriented columns form "microflowers" that follow the geometry of the templating surface. An array of "microtraps," in which every group of four attached nanocolumns of the HAIRS-2 design is held together by a hydrogel, is depicted in Fig. 4C. Such complex patterned movements would be impossible in the reported artificial-muscle systems, in which the polymers are actuated by an electric or magnetic field. Even more important, these patterns are reversible, in contrast to the cases of structural rearrangement and assembly reported in (20, 23). Structures shown in Fig. 4, B and C, open and close depending on the humidity level, as illustrated in Fig. 4, D and E. Their movements resemble the responsive behavior of carnivorous plants or pedicellaria (multijawed microforceps-like structures found on echinoderms), whose movement between the open and closed states functions in feeding and defense and as an antifouling mechanism, preventing the settlement and growth of microorganisms (24). These biological structures essentially exist as arrays of environmentally responsive actuators, as do our artificial dynamic patterns. The potential of these unique structures for various applications is now being explored (25). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 4.

(D and E) Optical micrographs imaging microtraps shown in (C) in a dry (D) and a wet (E) state. The switching of the nanocolumns from bent fourfold clusters to a vertical orientation is clear. From a mechanical viewpoint, there is a major difference between the HAIRS-1 and HAIRS-2 systems in the way that the nanocolumns are deformed. In the case of the HAIRS-1 system, the columns correspond essentially to stiff elements loaded under compression, whereas the shrinking hydrogel exerts tensile forces. This type of design was recognized long ago for its enormous potential in architectural construction by Buckminster-Fuller, who coined the term "tensegrity" (26), and the concept was later proposed as a mechanical model for the cell cytoskeleton (27). Such tensegrity structures consisting of stiff rods connected by soft springs under tension are currently being investigated in the context of mechanics for their inherent shape memory and related potential as actuators (28). The HAIRS-1 system is a realization of tensegrity at the microscale, where the nanocolumns redirect the tensile forces from the gel (which a priori would just lead to a reduction of the gel-layer thickness) into a lateral actuation (Fig. 1D). The movement x is controlled by the volume change of the gel and the length of the nanocolumns. If vw and vd represent the volume of the gel in the wet and the dry state, respectively, then cos = vd/vw and sin = x/h, so that . With the dimensions typically used in this study, the lateral actuation is on the order of x = 4 to 8 1/2m. A more complex topography of the confining surface, alternative (for example, nonquadratic) arrangements of the array of nanocolumns, the use of nanostructures of a different shape (such as blades), or a combination thereof allow for a variety of reversible patterned movements at the micrometer scale (Fig. 4, A and B), which might be technically exploited, such as in the context of microfluidics or photonics (25). HAIRS-2 systems go beyond the concept of tensegrity, in the sense that the beams do not stay straight and carry compressive loads, but instead they bend (Fig. 1E). Typically, the stiffness of thin beams is much less in bending than in compression (assuming that no buckling occurs). As a consequence, a large fraction of the deformation energy is stored in the bent columns, whichtendtogo backtotheir straight shape when the tensile stresses from the gel are released upon rewetting. The amount by which each column bends is a measure of the force exerted by the gel. This is in contrast to the HAIRS-1 system, where the force developed by the gel has no direct influence on the structure after drying. Using simple beam theory, we estimated the force f at which the bending of the silicon nanocolumns in the HAIRS-2 design occurs (figs. S4 and S5). This force depends very strongly on the aspect ratio. For an 8-1/2m-high column with an aspect ratio of either 80, 40, 20, or 10, the bending occurs at 1/250 nN, 1/2500 nN, 1/28 1/2N, or 100 1/2N, respectively. Moreover, the strain at the base cannot exceed the fracture strain of silicon. The consequence is that columns with a small aspect ratio can only undergo relatively small bending and then must break, whereas columns with an aspect ratio of 80 can fully bend to touch the surface without breaking. An aspect ratio of at least 20 is needed for sufficient bending of each beam to touch its neighbors to obtain the structure shown in Fig. 4, C and D. This mechanical assessment makes it possible to design a hydrogel/nanocolumns combination that enables a desired degree of directed actuation. We have developed hybrid architectures in which arrays of high-aspect-ratio silicon nanocolumns, either attached or free-standing, are embedded into a hydrogel film and are actuated into highly controlled, complex microstructures upon contraction and/or swelling of the polymer. The actuation is fast, reversible, reproducible, and robust. We believe that these architectures may lead to a variety of applications, including actuators, controlled reversible-pattern formation, microfluidics, reversible switching of the wetting behavior, tunable photonic structures, artificial muscles, and release systems (25).
Abstract Nanoelectromechanical systems were fabricated from single- and multilayer graphene sheets by mechanically exfoliating thin sheets from graphite over trenches in silicon oxide. Vibrations with fundamental resonant frequencies in the megahertz range are actuated either optically or electrically and detected optically by interferometry. We demonstrate room-temperature charge sensitivities down to 8 * 10-4 electrons per root hertz. The thinnest resonator consists of a single suspended layer of atoms and represents the ultimate limit of two-dimensional nanoelectromechanical systems. The miniaturization of electromechanical devices promises to be as revolutionary in the coming decades as the miniaturization of electronic devices was in the previous ones. Devices ranging from nanoscale resonators, switches, and valves have applications in tasks as diverse as information processing, molecular manipulation, and sensing. The prototypical nano-electromechanical system (NEMS) is a nanoscale resonator, a beam of material that vibrates in response to an applied external force (1, 2). The ultimate limit would be a resonator one atom thick, but this puts severe constraints on the material. As a single layer of atoms, it should be robust, stiff, and stable. Graphite consists of stacked layers of graphene sheets separated by 0.3 nm and held together by weak van der Waals forces (3). It has extremely high strength, stiffness, and thermal conductivity along the basal plane. In addition, graphite can be exfoliated onto an insulating substrate, producing micron-sized graphene sheets with thicknesses down to a single atomic layer (4-8). Thus far, research on these thin graphene sheets has focused primarily on their electronic properties. We demonstrate a method of suspending single- and multilayer graphene sheets over trenches and show that such sheets can be mechanically actuated. This work also makes a detailed study of the mechanical properties of these graphene resonators, including resonance frequency, spring constant, built-in tension, and quality factor. Suspended graphene sheets are fabricated with a peeling process similar to that reported previously (5-7). In our case, the graphene sheets are mechanically exfoliated over predefined trenches etched into a SiO2 surface (Fig. 1) (9). The result is a micron-scale doubly clamped beam or cantilever clamped to the SiO2 surface by van der Waals attraction. Some devices have prepatterned gold electrodes between the trenches to make electrical contact (Fig. 1, A and D). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

(E) A scanning electron microscope image of a few-layer (1/22) graphene resonator. Scale bar, 1 1/2m. A noncontact mode atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to quantitatively measure the thickness of the sheets on the substrate next to the trench, as shown in the inset in Fig. 1D. However, for sheets thinner than 2 to 3 nm, such measurements are unreliable (10-12). For these we used spatially resolved Raman spectroscopy to determine the number of layers (Fig. 1C) (10-12). The graphene sheet in Fig. 1B has an AFM-determined height of 0.9 nm. By comparison with previous results (10-12), the shape of the Raman peak near 2700 cm-1 suggests the sheet is two layers thick over the area lying on the SiO2 substrate (Fig. 1C), whereas the section suspended over the trench is a single graphene layer. All resonator measurements are performed at room temperature and a pressure of Vg at frequency f is superimposed on top of a constant voltage and applied to the graphene sheet. The result is an electrostatic force between the suspended graphene sheet and the substrate (1) where Cg' is the derivative of the gate capacitance with respect to the distance to the gate, and V dcg and Vg are, respectively, the dc and time-varying rf voltages applied to the gate (13). For optical actuation, the intensity of a diode laser focused on the sheet is modulated at frequency f, causing a periodic contraction/expansion of the layer that leads to motion. In both cases, the motion is detected by monitoring the reflected light intensity from a second laser with a fast photodiode (9). Figure 2A shows the measured amplitude versus frequency for a 15-nm-thick sheet suspended over a 5-1/2m trench. Multiple resonances are observed, the most prominent one at the lowest frequency. We associate this dominant peak with the fundamental vibrational mode; its detected intensity is largest when the motion is in-phase across the entire suspended section. We will limit our discussion primarily to this fundamental mode. A fit to a Lorentzian yields a resonant frequency fo = 42 MHz andaquality factor Q = 210. Figure 2B shows similar results for the single-layer graphene resonator from Fig. 1B; f0 = 70.5 MHz and Q = 78. Figure 3 shows the results of measurements of 33 resonators with thicknesses varying from a single atomic layer to sheets 75 nm thick. The frequency f0 of the fundamental modes varies from 1 MHz to 170 MHz, with quality factor Q of 20 to 850. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

Cantilevers, triangles; doubly clamped beams with t > 7 nm, filled squares; doubly clamped beams with t is the mass density; t, w, and L are the dimensions of the suspended graphene sheet; and the clamping coefficient, A, is 1.03 for doubly clamped beams and 0.162 for cantilevers (14). In the limit of small tension, Eq. 2 predicts that the resonance frequency f0 scales as t/L2. Figure 3A shows the resonant frequency of the fundamental mode for resonators with t > 7 nm as a function of t/L2 plotted as filled squares. Also plotted is the theoretical prediction, Eq. 2, in the limit of zero tension, for both cantilevers and beams, where we have used the known values for bulk graphite r = 2200 kg/m3 and E = 1.0 TPa (3). This is a valid comparison considering the extensive theoretical and experimental work that shows the basal plane of graphite to have a similar value for E as graphene and carbon nanotubes (3, 15). To account for possible errors in E, we plot dashed lines that correspond to values of E = 0.5 TPa and 2 TPa. The data follow the predictions reasonably accurately, indicating that thicker resonators are in the bending-dominated limit with a modulus E characteristic of the bulk material. This is among the highest modulus resonators to date, greater than 53 to 170 GPa in 12- to 300-nm-thick Si cantilevers and similar to single-walled carbon nanotubes and diamond NEMS (13, 16, 17). In contrast to ultrathin Si cantilevers, the graphene resonators show no degradation in Young's modulus with decreasing thickness (17). The resonant frequencies versus t/L2 for the resonators with t 1/2m, and w = 1.93 1/2m. From Eq. 2, this implies that the graphene resonator has a built-in tension of T = 13 nN. From the expression L/L = T/(EA), this corresponds to a strain of 2.2 * 10-3%. An important measure of any resonator is the normalized width of the resonance peak characterized by the quality factor Q=f0/f. A high Q is essential for most applications because it increases the sensitivity of the resonator to external perturbation. A plot of the Q versus the thickness for all the graphene resonators (Fig. 3B) shows that there is no clear dependence of Q on thickness. This contrasts with results on thicker NEMS resonators fabricated from silicon (18). The quality factors at room temperature are lower than diamond NEMS (2500 to 3000) of similar volume and significantly lower than high-stress Si3N4 nanostrings (200,000), yet similar to those reported in single-walled carbon nanotubes (50 to 100) (13, 16, 19). Preliminary studies on a 20-nm-thick resonator found a dramatic increase in Q with decreasing temperature (Q = 100 at 300 K to Q = 1800 at 50 K). This suggests that high Q operation of graphene resonators should be possible at low temperatures. Even when a resonator is not being driven, it will still oscillate due to thermal excitation by a root mean square (RMS) amount xth =[kBT/eff]1/2, where eff = meff 02 = 0.735Lwt02 is the effective spring constant of the mode (2). An example is shown in Fig. 4A, where a 5-nm-thick resonator with f0 = 35.8 MHz and eff = 0.7 N/m has a room-temperature thermal RMS motion of xth = 76 pm. For resonators for which the thermal vibrations can be measured, we use this thermal RMS motion to scale the measured photodetector voltage with resonator displacement (see supporting online text). Figure 4B shows such a rescaled plot of the displacement amplitude versus rf drive voltage. The resonator is linear up to displacements of 3 nm, or on the order of its thickness, where nonlinearities associated with additional tension are known to set in (2). This nonlinearity is characterized as a deviation from a linear increase in amplitude with driving force and accompanied by a decrease in Q (Fig. 4B).

Two applications of nanomechanical resonators are ultralow mass detection (see supporting online text) and ultrasensitive force detection. The ultimate limit on the force sensitivity is set by the thermal fluctuations in the resonator: (3) For the resonator in Fig. 4A, this results in a force sensitivity of 0.9 f N/Hz 1/2. From Eq. 1, this corresponds to a charge sensitivity of dQf = dFf d/Vgdc = 8 * 10-4 e/Hz 1/2, where d is the distance between the graphene sheet and the gate electrodes. This is a high sensitivity demonstrated at room temperature; at low temperatures, with the onset of higher quality factors, it could rival those of rf single-electron transistor electrometers (1 * 10-5 e/Hz 1/2) (20, 21). The high Young's modulus, extremely low mass, and large surface area make these resonators ideally suited for use as mass, force, and charge sensors (22-28). The application of graphene NEMS extends beyond just mechanical resonators. This robust conducting membrane can act as a nanoscale supporting structure or atomically thin membrane separating two disparate environments.
This article has a correction. Please see:Is corrected by - May 04, 2007 Abstract There has been considerable speculation about the role of water and water complexes in chemical gas-phase reactions, including the conjecture that water may act as a molecular catalyst through its ability to form hydrogen bonds. Here, we present kinetic studies in which the effect of water on the rate of the reaction between hydroxyl radicals and acetaldehyde has been measured directly in Laval nozzle expansions at low temperatures. An increasing enhancement of the reaction rate by added water was found with decreasing temperatures between 300 and 60 kelvin. Quantum chemical calculations and statistical rate theory support our conclusions that this observation is due to the reduction of an intrinsic reaction barrier caused by specific water aggregation. The results suggest that even single water molecules can act as catalysts in radical-molecule reactions. Water introduces many unusual features into the kinetics and energetics of chemical and biological reaction systems, which are difficult to rationalize on a molecular level (1, 2). Beyond the well-known properties of bulk water, there is evidence that even single confined water molecules in molecular aggregates may have a decisive influence on gas phase chemistry (3). An intriguing question is whether water molecules can even act as true catalysts in chemical reactions, for example, through their ability to form hydrogen bonds. A number of molecule-water complexes have evidenced photochemistry distinct from that of the isolated molecules (4). Complexes of water with ozone (5), sulfuric acid (6), nitric acid (7), nitrous oxide (8), and chlorine dioxide (9-11) are examples of water aggregates that may be important in atmospheric photochemistry. Beyond its ability to influence photochemistry, water is known to form complexes with active species such as radicals and polar molecules in thermal reactions (4, 12, 13), and such complexation may alter intrinsic reaction barriers in bimolecular reactions. In addition, the radical-complex mechanism (14) is well known to have a characteristic impact on recombination processes, which could be enhanced by water molecules. Last, water may act as a particularly efficient collision partner to collisionally stabilize intermediates of such reactions. Unfortunately, all these effects (hereafter referred to as the catalysis, the radical-complex, and the energy-transfer mechanisms) may influence overall reaction yields and rates in bimolecular reactions (14) and are often difficult to distinguish. For example, there is experimental (15) and theoretical (4) evidence that the hydroperoxy radical (HO2) forms a hydrogen-bonded complex with a water molecule, which has the potential to affect the kinetics of HO2 reactions. Along these lines, the rate constant for the self-reaction of HO2 to yield H2O2 and O2, which proceeds via a long-lived intermediate, is somewhat faster in the presence of water than in its absence (4, 16, 17). A similar effect has been observed for the reaction of hydroperoxy radicals with nitrogen dioxide in the presence of water (18). However, the origin of the documented impact of water on the kinetics in general remains unclear. Although "prereaction" complexes of water in chemical reactions have been suggested in the past (16), a conclusive mechanism and a detailed kinetic analysis of the systems were not given. The general problem for an understanding of such kinetic systems is that they depend upon temperature, pressure, and specific molecular parameters and so require a detailed kinetic analysis using reaction rate theory and high-level quantum chemistry (14). Following up on a long-standing conjecture that even single or few water molecules may alter energetics in general and reaction barriers in particular or favor reaction sites, the goal of this study was to investigate the role of water as a real catalyst in chemical gas-phase reactions potentially relevant for atmospheric chemistry and, in particular, to provide a clear example for a water-catalyzed radical-molecule reaction. The fast H-atom abstraction reaction of OH with acetaldehyde proved to be a good system for studying the effect of water aggregation on the kinetics. The reaction does not involve long-lived, strongly bound intermediates such as those found in other complex-forming bimolecular reactions, for example, in the reaction of OH with CO proceeding via HOCO complexes (14). Recent experimental and theoretical work has provided evidence for the assumption that the reaction proceeds predominantly through abstraction of the aldehydic hydrogen atom (19-22). The addition of the OH radical to the double bond does not take place because its activation energy is much larger than that for hydrogen abstraction (23, 24). In addition, the aldehydic hydrogen atom has a relatively small binding energy compared with that of hydrogen atoms in the methyl group. A prereactive complex CH3CHOHO has been postulated by D'Anna et al. (24) and Alvarez-Idaboy et al. (23), and its binding energy was estimated to be 18 kJ mol-1. Although transient prereactive complexes have not been directly characterized experimentally, their presence has been identified indirectly in several radical-molecule reactions and associated with a negative temperature dependence of the reaction rate (25, 26). Nielsen and co-workers calculated barriers (relative to the reactant energy) to aldehydic H abstraction, methyl H abstraction, and OH addition to the carbonyl bond of -14.2 kJ mol-1, 12.1 kJ mol-1, and 30.9 kJ mol-1, respectively (24). A negative temperature dependence of the reaction rate at higher temperatures has also been reported (22) without a theoretical analysis of the effect. We measured rates and rate constants for the OH + CH3CHO reaction in the presence and absence of water vapor by using a pulsed Laval nozzle expansion (25, 27) (Fig. 1A). The reaction was followed by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to monitor the decay of OH radical concentration. The rate constants were determined over a temperature range of 58 to 300 K. The decay profiles can be fitted well by an exponential time law (Fig. 1B). Plots of pseudo-first-order rate constants versus acetaldehyde concentrations (in nitrogen buffer gas) at a constant total density yield the second-order rate constants. Two experiments are shown for a temperature (T) of 77 K with and without added water vapor (Fig. 1C). From the slopes of the plots, rate constants of 4.6 * 10-11 cm3molecule-1s-1 and 9.0 * 10-11 cm3molecule-1s-1 were determined. Several experiments were averaged for a particular temperature (27). Averaged second-order rate constants of the reaction of OH with acetaldehyde alone and in the presence of water vapor at temperatures between 300 K and 60 K are shown in Fig. 2.

(Inset) Data from (22) (open squares), (19) (open circles), and this work (solid square) for the reaction without water. Solid line indicates simplified SACM calculation. Deviation of the plot format in Fig. 2 from a normal Arrhenius-type plot (log k versus 1/T) is somewhat arbitrary, and there is no reason to expect a linearization of the data. Nevertheless, the chosen plot is often used in cases where bimolecular rate constants increase with decreasing temperature. The origin of the socalled negative temperature dependence depends strongly on the molecular system. As shown below, one reason for the effect may be a "reef"-type barrier below the energy of the reactants in the entrance channel of the reaction, as opposed to a much larger barrier in other cases that would yield the typical Arrhenius behavior. The water content of the beam was measured with off-line infrared spectroscopy and determined to be 3%. The shaded area between the dashed lines connecting the data points marks the difference between the two data sets and illustrates the effect of added water. Experiments of the reaction without added water in the range between 500 and 200 K measured by Crowley et al. (22) and Michael et al. (19) are shown and compared with our data point at 300 K (Fig. 2, insets). In our study, we significantly extended the temperature range and confirmed the negative dependence on temperature of the reaction rate down to 58 K. In addition, small amounts of added water accelerated the reaction (Fig. 2). Although the effect is small at 300 K, it becomes prominent at lower temperatures. The effect also depends on the water content of the buffer gas. If the concentration of water is significantly below 3%, no significant acceleration is seen. On the other hand, a water content of more than 8% increases aggregation in such a way that the intensity of the OH signal is significantly reduced, and the reaction becomes difficult to measure because of an overall quenching of LIF. From the dependence of the reaction rate on water and acetaldehyde concentrations and the density range in which we find a linearity of the rate versus reactant and water concentrations, as well as the experimental observation that larger clusters (acetaldehyde and acetaldehyde-water) are much less reactive, tending to decrease the actual reactant concentration (and in turn the rate constant), the experiments suggest that small acetaldehyde-water clusters as reactants are responsible for the observed effect. We note that we did not measure "pure" rate constants. Instead, the observed temperature-dependent rate constant k(T) in the presence of water is the sum of two contributions from the unclustered and clustered species, respectively. Both fractions f0 and faggr are associated with their rate constants k0 and kaggr. This situation can be symbolically expressed by (1) In order to rationalize the effect of water and water clusters on the reaction rate, we performed quantum chemical calculations [coupled-cluster with single and double and perturbative triple excitations, CCSD(T)] to elucidate the energetics and structure of the intermediate species of the reaction (Fig. 3). Because the acceleration effect has been seen only for small water concentrations, we posited a significant role of single water molecules in complexes with acetaldehyde. For comparison, calculations were also carried out for the reaction without water. We refer to two kinds of complex: the hydrogen-bonded one between acetaldehyde and water, which acts as a reagent (with OH) in the experiments with H2O present, and the transient prereaction complexes for the OH plus CH3CHO reaction and for the reaction between OH and CH3CHO-H2O hydrogen-bonded complexes. Optimized structures for complexes and transition states with and without water are shown in Fig. 4. Calculated structures for the prereaction complex (Fig. 4A) and the transition state (Fig. 4B) in the absence of water are in agreement with previous work (24).

(C) and (D) are prospective water-acetaldehyde clusters from which (D) was identified to be relevant for the reaction. (E) is the prereaction complex, and (F) is the transition state for the reaction in the presence of water. According to quantum chemical calculations (Fig. 3A), the H-abstraction reaction is governed by a shallow well and a small barrier separating the prereaction complex and the products (H2O and CH3CO). The barrier considered here may be described as a submerged barrier or reef on the path of minimum energy of the reaction, one whose energy maximum lies below the asymptotic reagent energy but above the earlier energy minimum associated with the prereaction complex. This situation corresponds to a loose entrance-rigid exit complex-forming bimolecular reaction, as characterized in (14), with an overall rate constant expressed as (2) kass, kforw, and kback are specific rate constants (27) and depend upon the energy and the angular momentum of the intermediate complex. Specific rate constants kforw and kback were calculated first as a function of energy and the angular momentum. A simplified statistical adiabatic channel model (14) was applied by using energies and calculated vibrational frequencies of the reactants, the precomplex, and the transition state from our quantum chemistry calculations. The determined rate constants at the energies relevant for the temperatures of this experiment showed that lifetimes of the complexes are in the lower picosecond range because of the shallow potential well. A comparison of the sum of kforw and kback with Lennard-Jones collision frequencies for acetaldehyde-N2 collisions unambiguously showed that the intermediate, even up to pressures of 1 bar, cannot be collisionally stabilized and that the reaction is in its low-pressure limit. These findings explain why no pressure dependence has been found for this reaction (22). One could argue that the situation changes when water replaces nitrogen as a collision partner. Although the collision frequency for water is about 10 times that for nitrogen (28), the average energy transferred in a collision is about 5 times larger (28) for water collisions. Therefore, water diluted to about 3% in nitrogen should not be more efficient than nitrogen alone in stabilizing the reaction complexes. The large energy transfer efficiency of water relative to the nitrogen buffer gas is compensated by its small concentration in the system and thus cannot be responsible for the observed enhancement of the reaction rate. We have also used statistical unimolecular rate theory (27) to calculate the overall thermal rate constant as a function of temperature (14). Results from the calculation for the overall reaction without added water explicitly took into account the energy and the angular momentum dependence of the rate constants for the formation of the prereaction complex, as well as the competition between forward reaction over the barrier and backward dissociation according to the formalism given in (14) (Fig. 2). The observed negative temperature dependence was well reproduced, confirming the presence of the prereaction complex. The observed negative temperature dependence can be rationalized in terms of the different energy and angular momentum dependences of the specific rate constants kforw and kback of the intermediate complex and the resulting vibrational and rotational channel switchings (14). This result shows that a reef-type barrier and the corresponding transition state may be rate-determining despite their potential energy lying below the energy of the reagents. Our quantum chemical calculations shed light on the origin of water's accelerating effect on this H-atom abstraction reaction. First, we calculated energies and structures for the reaction in the absence of water (Figs. 3 and 4, A and B). The 8 kJ mol-1 barrier, i.e., the difference in energy between the prereaction complex (structure 4A) and the transition state (structure 4B), is consistent with previous results (24). Next, we optimized the geometries of prospective 1:1 water-acetaldehyde complexes and found two nearly isoenergetic structures, with water top-bound in one (Fig. 4C) and side-bound in the other (Fig. 4D). The top-bound cluster reacts with OH via a transition state (TS) similar in energy to that calculated for the naked acetaldehyde, with no significant impact on the reaction barrier. In contrast, the side-bound species can form a cyclic prereaction complex with OH at a substantially lower energy (Fig. 4E), leading also to a substantial reduction of the energy of the TS (Fig. 4F) and thus the barrier of the reaction. Quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T) level of theory that include zero-point energy correction yield an 8 kJ mol-1 barrier separating the prereaction complex from the TS in the absence of water, but only a 0.6 kJ mol-1 barrier involving the side-bound acetaldehyde-water complex. Thus, the calculations show that even a single water molecule can accelerate the reaction by significant barrier lowering. If the water enhancement of the reaction rate is due to a lowering or even a removal of the intrinsic reaction barrier of the prereaction water complexes, Eq. 2 helps in understanding that this effect in turn increases the rate constant, kforw, for the forward reaction while lowering kback due to the larger number of molecular degrees of freedom of the complex (Fig. 4E). In the extreme, this effect could increase the overall rate constant for clustered reactants to the association-limited value, k kass, corresponding to the maximal observable catalytic effect. As noted above and expressed in Eq. 1, the measured temperature-dependent rate constant k(T) in the presence of water is the sum of two contributions, namely, from the clustered and unclustered species. k0 is given by the red line in Fig. 2, whereas kaggr, because of the near absence of an intrinsic barrier, is expected to be close to kass and therefore only weakly temperature-dependent. The marked negative temperature dependence of k(T) in the presence of water is therefore attributed to that of faggr and not of kaggr. For temperatures close to 300 K, the degree of clustering faggr is small, and the reaction is not much enhanced. With decreasing temperature, the degree of clustering faggr increases, which increases the rate. Together with the energetics of the reaction, thus, faggr controls the catalytic effect. From the argumentation above, an important quantity is the concentration of CH3CHO-H2O hydrogen-bonded complexes in the experiments where 1/23% of H2O is present in the gas mixtures. Unfortunately, this quantity cannot be measured nor easily calculated, because it may depend upon the kinetics of the CH3CHO + H2O complexing process. Estimations of faggr from equilibrium constants and equilibrium concentrations for the 1:1 complexes (which are an upper limit to their actual concentration) using our ab initio data show that the temperature dependence of the rate constant qualitatively correlates with faggr for 1:1 complexes and that faggr may approach unity for temperatures well below 100 K. Although the kinetic data and our quantum chemical calculations strongly suggest that the rate enhancement is due to specific water clusters and that even single water molecules may lower reaction barriers, the question about the role of larger clusters arises. At the lowest temperatures in principle, larger clusters such as clusters of acetaldehyde and larger water-acetaldehyde complexes may also exist to some extent. A significant impact of acetaldehyde clusters can be more or less excluded, because this manifests itself in a pronounced curvature of plots like those in Fig. 1B. Our experience is that larger clustering of the reactants obviously decreases the active reactant concentration. The same argumentation holds for acetaldehyde-water clusters; larger clusters will also decrease the effective reactant concentration. In general, working in concentration and density regions, where a linear dependence of the rate constant as a function of concentration is observed, avoids these complications. It is also known that water forms complexes with the hydroxyl radical and pure water clusters. In the present experiment, however, we were not sensitive to these types of complexation, because the rate constants were recorded for constant OH and water concentrations. The catalytic effect that manifests itself in an increase of the overall bimolecular reaction rate is due to clustering of the reactant at specific sites and in turn a reduction of an intrinsic reaction barrier through the formation of specific hydrogen bonds. The water molecules are not actively involved in the reaction (e.g., through bond breaking) other than forming hydrogen bonds. We are aware that any general conclusions about radical-molecule reactions involving hydrates may be premature. In other related studies of potential water catalysis, it was found that, although barriers are lowered upon hydration, the dynamics and residual barriers may still be unfavorable for reaction (29). However, we do anticipate that this effect is not restricted to the HO-CH3CHO system but a general low-temperature feature of a larger class of reactions of potential relevance in atmospheric chemistry. Lastly, we note that a catalytic role of water in (condensed phase) organic reactions has been reported before. However, the effect described here should be clearly distinguished from effects of microsolvation (causing ionic dissociation), classical acid-base catalysis of organic reactions, and cases in which water is actively involved as a reaction partner (e.g., as a proton donor or acceptor).
Abstract Mars was once wet but is now dry, and the fate of its ancient carbon dioxide atmosphere is one of the biggest puzzles in martian planetology. We have measured the current loss rate due to the solar wind interaction for different species: Q(O+) = 1.61023 per second = 4 grams per second (g s-1), Q(O +2) = 1.51023 s-1 = 8 g s-1, and Q(CO +2) = 81022 s-1 = 6 g s-1 in the energy range of 30 to 30,000 electron volts per charge. These rates can be propagated backward over a period of 3.5 billion years, resulting in the total removal of 0.2 to 4 millibar of carbon dioxide and a few centimeters of water. The escape rate is low, and thus one has to continue searching for water reservoirs and carbon dioxide stores on or beneath the planetary surface and investigate other escape channels. How is the solar wind erosion of the martian atmosphere related to the history of this planet? The "warm and wet early Mars" model suggests that flowing liquid water caused the surface erosion features, such as outflow channels. The water was sustained in the liquid state because of a much higher atmospheric temperature in the past caused by a strong greenhouse effect. The amount of water needed to produce the observed geomorphologic features is about 600 m to 1 km of the equivalent water layer (1). The amount of atmospheric pressure needed to maintain the required greenhouse effect would be a few bars of CO2 (2). The inventory of the present amounts of water and carbon dioxide [the most recent "nondiscovery" of carbonates by Mars Express (3)] cannot yet identify any appreciable amounts of these materials comparable with the amount present on ancient Mars, although the presence of the water in the past is unambiguously confirmed by Mars Exploration Rovers (4). What happened to the martian water and carbon dioxide? Apart from catastrophic removal of the ancient atmosphere by an impact at the end of the Noachian and still-to-be-discovered hidden reservoirs, the solar wind erosion is a plausible idea to explain the absence of notable amounts of water and carbon dioxide on Mars today. When the solar wind encounters a non-magnetized atmospheric planet, a void of the solar wind is formed. The void created by the magnetic field resulting from the currents induced in the ionosphere is called an induced magnetosphere (5). It is separated from the solar wind by an induced magnetosphere boundary. Previous investigations (6) based on the magnetic field measurements revealed in the same region a boundary termed the magnetic-pile-up boundary (MPB). The identity of these two boundaries is still to be confirmed. The void is filled by escaping or accelerated ions, which are the ions from the martian atmosphere with energy exceeding the escape energy (2.1 eV for O+). At least two processes of the acceleration are established. Those are the pick-up process (7) and acceleration resulting from charge separation due to the electric field (8). Other mechanisms are probably also active. Carlsson et al. (9) have established the mass composition of the escaping plasma. They found that the flux ratios of O +2/O+ and CO +2/O+ are 0.9 and 0.2, respectively. Apart from the escape due to the accelerated ions, the martian atmosphere erodes due to thermal plasma removal, sputtering, and loss of fast atoms (mostly oxygen) resulting from the exogenic dissociative recombination. This study reports the escape rates of ions accelerated to energies in the range of 30 to 30,000 eV per charge. The earlier measurements of the escape rate in the similar energy range were attempted by the Phobos-2 mission. The obtained O+ escape rates were 31025 s-1 (10) and 51024 s-1 (11). The rate in (10) is in the energy range of 0.5 to 24,000 eV (the lower limit is uncertain because of the absence of the spacecraft potential control). The total escape rates reported here are based on the measurements by the ion mass analyzer (IMA) of ASPERA-3 (Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms), an instrument onboard the Mars Express mission (12, 13). The IMA does not resolve directly O+, O2+, CO+, and CO2+, but the mass composition can be obtained by fitting of the wide mass peak by Gaussian peaks corresponding to the individual masses. The position of the peaks as a function of energy and mass, as well as their width, were obtained in laboratory and in-flight calibrations (9). The technique works reliably except for CO+, which cannot be separated from O +2. However, the ionospheric models (14) predict the CO+ density to be at least a factor of 100 lower than that of O +2 at 300-km height, where the ionosphere starts to interact with the solar wind (5). We thus assume that the whole flux associated with the O2+/CO+ peak is attributed to molecular oxygen. The observational period in question is from 1 May 2004 to 30 May 2006, which corresponds to approximately one martian year. The spatial coverage is regarded as dense and statistically sufficient (supporting online text). The total escape rate is calculated by mapping the planetary ion flux distribution in the plane perpendicular to the Sun-planet line. First, the distribution function measured for three ions, O+, O+2, and CO+2, along the spacecraft trajectory is integrated over energy and solid angle. The obtained integral flux (cm-2 s-1) is assigned to the orbit interval corresponding to 192-s IMA accumulation time in the frame of reference related to the interplanetary electric field. In this Cartesian coordinate system, MSE (Mars-Sun-Electric field), centered at Mars, the x axis points toward the Sun, z coaligns with the interplanetary electric field plane, and y completes the right-hand system. The direction of the electric field, E, is calculated from the Mars Global Surveyor measurements (15). As shown most recently by (15), the ion-escape fluxes are organized by the E-field due to specific topology of the magnetic field in the wake region (where main variations of the magnetic field lie in the plane perpendicular to E) and due to finite gyroradius of the planetary ions comparable with the planetary size. The planetary ions fill the whole downtail region inside the MPB up to the XMSE = -4 (Fig. 1). The flux distribution correlates well with the E-field direction (Figs. 1 and 2). The escape takes place predominately through the plasma sheet and adjusted region inside the MPB with the maximum escape rate deep inside the eclipse. The escape area is rather limited and is approximately 2RM * 2RM = 4RM2, where RM is the radius of Mars (Fig. 2). It is worth noting that although the maximum averaged flux in the plasma sheet region is about 2106 cm-2 s-1, the instance flux can reach 5107 cm-2 s-1, which corresponds to a planetary ion-number density of 20 cm-3. Integrating the maps shown in Fig. 2 over the area, we obtain the total averaged escape rates for three species: The ratios of the total escape rates relative to oxygen are Q(O2+)/Q(O+) = 0.9 and Q(CO2+)/Q(O+)= 0.5. The main constituents of the escaping plasma are O2+ and O+ with a submixture of CO2+. Although the ratio Q(O +2)/Q(O+) is in agreement with the ratio reported by (9), Q(CO +2)/Q(O+) is a factor of 2.5 higher. This is related to a less accurate mass separation in this study between O +2 and CO +2 performed automatically, whereas in (9), it was made manually. The numbers obtained are almost a factor of 100 lower than those from Phobos-2. The current escape is extremely weak. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. The integral fluxes (cm-2 s-1) for all three ions (O+, O2+, CO2+) together averaged over the range -0.8RM M(CO2) and M(H2O), lost through this particular channel over 3.5 gigayears (Gy) (supporting online text). Using a hybrid code, Modolo et al. (16) calculated the escape rates for O+ and O +2 for different solar conditions. The calculated total escape rate for the heavy ions (O+ and O +2) is 5.71023 s-1, compared to 3.11023 s-1 in this study; i.e., the calculated and measured rates are in very good agreement. Also, the measured escape rates are in very good agreement with MHD (magnetohydrodynamics) simulations by (17). They provide the rates Q(O+) = 2.51023 s-1, Q(O +2) = 2.91023 s-1, Q (CO +2) = 3.11022 s-1 for the solar minimum conditions. As can be seen, even mass composition is quite well reproduced. Because the calculated escape rates are in good agreement with the measured ones at the solar minimum conditions, we can thus rely on the calculated factor of the escape increase for the solar maximum conditions. Modolo et al. (16) predicted the factor to be 4.56 for the O+ escaperate increase, and Ma et al. (17) predicted the same factor to be 4.58. Scaling the measured rates on this factor brings the total escaped amount of carbon dioxide to 0.8 to 43 mbar, and the upper limits for water to 4 to 70 cm. Thus, we conclude that the solar-activity variations cannot increase the estimated total escape on a factor of 100 needed for evolutionary relevant numbers. The estimated total losses of carbon dioxide and water are much lower than the few hundred meters of H2O and 1 to 5 bar of CO2 required for the "wet and warm early Mars" model. Therefore, either other escape channels were or are operational, e.g., impact atmospheric removal, photochemical or cold plasma/bulk escape, or water and carbon dioxide are stored in nonidentified reservoirs. We emphasize that this study considers only one channel for the escape to space. The determination of the escape rates in the form of cold plasma clouds (bulk escape) or via sputtering and photochemical reactions is beyond the scope of the ASPERA-3 experiment capabilities. To compare the measured escape rates with the other escape channels, we determined logarithm-averaged oxygen escape rates over all available models given in the review (18). The photochemical O+ escape rates are estimated to be 21025 s-1 on average; the sputtering, 71023 s-1; and the bulk/cold plasma escape, 11026 s-1[Phobos-2 database (18)]. As can be seen, at least in simulations, estimated photochemical or cold plasma escape rates are substantially higher than the reported numbers. Precise measurements of the cold plasma, photochemical, and sputtering escape rates must await future missions.
Abstract People typically exhibit greater sensitivity to losses than to equivalent gains when making decisions. We investigated neural correlates of loss aversion while individuals decided whether to accept or reject gambles that offered a 50/50 chance of gaining or losing money. A broad set of areas (including midbrain dopaminergic regions and their targets) showed increasing activity as potential gains increased. Potential losses were represented by decreasing activity in several of these same gain-sensitive areas. Finally, individual differences in behavioral loss aversion were predicted by a measure of neural loss aversion in several regions, including the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex. Many decisions, such as whether to invest in the stock market or to accept a new job, involve the possibility of gaining or losing relative to the status quo. When faced with such decisions, most people are markedly risk averse. For instance, people typically reject gambles that offer a 50/50 chance of gaining or losing money, unless the amount that could be gained is at least twice the amount that could be lost (e.g., a 50/50 chance to either gain $100 or lose $50) (1). Prospect theory, the most successful behavioral model of decision-making under risk and uncertainty (1, 2), explains risk aversion for "mixed" (gain/loss) gambles using the concept of loss aversion: People are more sensitive to the possibility of losing objects or money than they are to the possibility of gaining the same objects or amounts of money (1, 3-5). Thus, people typically require a potential gain of at least $100 to make up for exposure to a potential loss of $50 because the subjective impact of losses is roughly twice that of gains. Similarly, people demand substantially more money to part with objects that they have been given than what they would have been willing to pay to acquire those objects in the first place (6). Loss aversion also has been used to explain a wide range of economic behaviors outside the laboratory (7, 8). Further, loss aversion is seen in trading behavior of both children as young as age five (9) and capuchin monkeys (10), which suggests that it may reflect a fundamental feature of how potential outcomes are assessed by the primate brain. Previous neuroimaging studies of responses to monetary gains or losses have focused on activity associated with the anticipation of immediate outcomes ("anticipated" utility) (11, 12) or the actual experience of gaining or losing money ("experienced" utility) (11, 13, 14) rather than specifically investigating which brain systems represent potential losses versus gains when a decision is being made ("decision" utility). Behavioral researchers have shown that anticipated, experienced, and decision utilities often diverge in dramatic ways, which raises the possibility that the corresponding brain systems involved may also differ (15). In the current study, we aimed to isolate activity associated with the evaluation of a gamble when choosing whether or not to accept it (i.e., decision utility) without the expectation that the gamble would be immediately resolved. This allowed us to test whether neural responses during the evaluation of potential outcomes are similar to patterns previously reported in studies of anticipated and experienced outcomes. One fundamental question for the study of decision-making is whether loss aversion reflects the engagement of distinct emotional processes when potential losses are considered. It has been suggested that enhanced sensitivity to losses is driven by negative emotions, such as fear or anxiety (16). This notion predicts that exposure to increasing potential losses should be associated with increased activity in brain structures thought to mediate negative emotions in decision-making [such as the amygdala or anterior insula; compare with (17, 18)]. Alternatively, loss aversion could reflect an asymmetric response to losses versus gains within a single system that codes for the subjective value of the potential gamble, such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC)/orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventral striatum (11, 19, 20). To examine the neural systems that process decision utility, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while participants decided whether to accept or reject mixed gambles that offered a 50/50 chance of either gaining one amount of money or losing another amount (Fig. 1A) (21). To encourage participants to reflect on the subjective attractiveness of each gamble rather than to rely on a fixed decision rule, we asked them to indicate one of four responses to each gamble (strongly accept, weakly accept, weakly reject, and strongly reject). In order to allow for separate estimates of neural responses to gains and losses, the sizes of the potential gain and loss were manipulated independently, with gains ranging from $10 to $40 (in increments of $2) and losses ranging from $5 to $20 (in increments of $1). We chose these ranges because previous studies indicate that people are, on average, roughly twice as sensitive to losses as to gains (1, 5); thus, we expected that, for most participants, this range of gambles would elicit a wide range of attitudes, from strong acceptance to indifference to strong rejection. To introduce incentive-compatible payoffs, we endowed participants with $30 one week before scanning and told participants that one decision from each of three scanning runs would be honored for real money.

During each trial, the participant was presented for 3 s with a display showing the size of the potential gain (in green) and loss (in red). After the accept or reject response, a variable interval was presented to allow for optimal deconvolution of fMRI responses to each trial (27). Gambles were not resolved during scanning. The values of gain and loss for each trial were sampled from the gain/loss matrix, as shown here for two example gambles; a gamble from each cell in this 16 * 16 matrix was presented during scanning, but the data were collapsed into a 4 * 4 matrix for analysis. All combinations of gains and losses were presented. ISI, interstimulus interval. (B) Color-coded heatmap of probability of gamble acceptance at each level of gain/loss (red indicates high willingness to accept the gamble, and blue indicates low willingness to accept the gamble). (C) Color-coded heatmap of response times (red indicates slower response times, and blue indicates faster response times). We assessed behavioral sensitivity to gains and losses by fitting a logistic regression to each participant's acceptability judgments collected during scanning, using the size of the gain and loss as independent variables. Based on this analysis, we computed a measure of behavioral loss aversion as the ratio of the (absolute) loss response to the gain response, which yielded a median = 1.93 (range: 0.99 to 6.75). This finding is consistent with the observations that participants were, on average, indifferent to gambles in which the potential gain was twice the amount of the potential loss (Fig. 1B) and that participants were slower to decide whether or not to accept these gambles (Fig. 1C). These behavioral data also accord well with previous findings (1, 5). We first analyzed the imaging data to identify brain regions whose activation correlated with the size of the potential gain or loss, using parametric regressors (21). This analysis isolated a set of regions responsive to the size of potential gains when evaluating gambles (averaging over levels of loss) (Fig. 2 and fig. S2). The gain-responsive network included regions previously shown to be associated with the anticipation and receipt of monetary rewards, including the dorsal and ventral striatum, VMPFC, ventrolateral PFC, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), OFC, and dopaminergic midbrain regions. There were no regions that showed decreasing activation as gains increased. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2. Whole-brain analysis of parametric responses to size of potential loss (left) or gain (right). Statistical maps were projected onto an average cortical surface with the use of multifiducial mapping in CARET software (28); coronal slices (y = 10) are included to show ventral striatal activation. All maps are corrected for multiple comparisons at the whole-brain level by means of cluster-based Gaussian random field correction (29) at P 0.4 in all voxels by means of randomization tests). Given the specific prediction regarding loss-related activity in the amygdala and insula based on previous studies of experienced utility and risk aversion (11, 18), we performed further analyses that focused on these areas. Even at a very liberal uncorrected threshold of P gain for 14 out of 16 participants, P = 0.004; VMPFC: loss > gain for 13 out of 16 participants, P = 0.021). In order to more directly assess the relationship between neural loss aversion and behavioral loss aversion, we performed a whole-brain robust regression analysis with these measures (21). This analysis revealed significant correlations between behavioral and neural loss aversion in several regions, including bilateral ventral striatum (Fig. 4), bilateral lateral and superior PFC (pre-supplementary motor area), and right inferior parietal cortex (figs. S6 and S7 and table S2). These results demonstrate that differences in behavior were strongly predicted by differences in neural responses.

Regression line and P value were computed with the use of robust regression by iteratively reweighted least squares to prevent the influence of outliers; however, this regression also remained highly significant (P = 0.004) when the extreme data point (top right-hand corner) was removed from the analysis. loss and gain are the unstandardized regression coefficients for the loss and gain variables, respectively. The present study replicates the common behavioral pattern of risk aversion for mixed gambles that offer a 50/50 chance of gaining or losing money and shows that this pattern of behavior is directly tied to the brain's greater sensitivity to potential losses than gains. These results provide evidence in favor of one of the fundamental claims of prospect theory (1, 2), namely that the function that maps money to subjective value is markedly steeper for losses than gains [see also (4)]. Moreover, mediation analysis (21) suggests that individual differences in behavioral loss aversion (as inferred by willingness to accept mixed gambles) are driven primarily by individual differences in neural sensitivity to potential losses. Although the present study focuses on loss aversion in the context of mixed gambles, recent work has found that the coefficient of loss aversion (i.e., the ratio of sensitivity to losses versus gains) is highly correlated across risky and riskless contexts (23). Therefore, we surmise that a similar mechanism may contribute to other manifestations of loss aversion. Previous studies have shown that anticipated or experienced losses give rise to activation in regions that have been associated with negative emotions, such as the amygdala or anterior insula (11, 17, 18). In contrast, the present study demonstrates that, in the context of decision-making, potential losses are represented by decreasing activity in regions that seem to code for subjective value rather than by increasing activity in regions associated with negative emotions. This difference between present and previous results reinforces the importance of distinguishing among experienced, anticipated, and decision utility in economic theories of choice (15). It is possible that amygdala engagement for experienced losses reflects negative prediction error (11, 24) rather than negative value, whereas the lack of immediate outcomes in the present study (which was designed to isolate decision utility) precludes the computation of prediction errors. The neural basis of decision under risk was investigated in a recent study by De Martino et al. (25), who found that amygdala activity correlated with choices of risky gambles framed as losses and sure outcomes framed as gains. However, the reflection in risk attitudes when moderate-probability gambles are framed as losses versus gains has been attributed in prospect theory primarily to the reflection in curvature of the value function for losses versus gains (2) and secondarily to distortions in probability weighting rather than to loss aversion. In contrast, we asked participants in the present study to evaluate balanced (50/50) gain/loss gambles, which allowed us to isolate the role of loss aversion. Thus, although amygdala activation may play a role in some decisions under risk, it does not appear to be a necessary component in loss aversion. The present results illustrate how neuroimaging can be used to directly test predictions stemming from behavioral theories: in this case, the prediction from prospect theory that risk aversion for mixed gambles can be attributed to enhanced sensitivity to losses. Neural loss aversion was observed throughout, though not strictly limited to, the targets of the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine (DA) systems. It is tempting to speculate that individual differences in behavioral and neural loss aversion observed in the present study may be related to naturally occurring differences in DA function, though the relationship between genetic variation in the DA system and personality traits such as impulsivity and risk taking remains largely unknown (26). Further, the diminished neural sensitivity to losses among individuals who were less loss averse (i.e., more risk seeking) may shed light on a number of neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorders, such as substance abuse, pathological gambling, and antisocial personality disorder, that are associated with increased risk taking and impulsive behavior. This suggests that studies integrating methods from behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience may provide greater insight into the nature of these disorders.
Abstract The germinal center (GC) is an important site for the generation and selection of B cells bearing high-affinity antibodies, yet GC cell migration and interaction dynamics have not been directly observed. Using two-photon microscopy of mouse lymph nodes, we revealed that GC B cells are highly motile and extend long cell processes. They transited between GC dark and light zones and divided in both regions, although these B cells resided for only several hours in the light zone where antigen is displayed. GC B cells formed few stable contacts with GC T cells despite frequent encounters, and T cells were seen to carry dead B cell blebs. On the basis of these observations, we propose a model in which competition for T cell help plays a more dominant role in the selection of GC B cells than previously appreciated. Germinal centers (GC) represent critical sites within organized lymphoid tissues in which B cell responses to antigen are amplified and refined in specificity. A classical model of GC function holds that B cells in the dark zone undergo rapid rounds of proliferation and somatic hypermutation of their antibody genes, followed by exit from the cell cycle and movement to the light zone, where the B cells undergo selection based on the affinity of their surface antibody for antigen (1-5). The selection process is thought to involve competition between GC B cells for capture of antigen in the form of immune complexes displayed on the processes of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (1, 3, 5, 6). However, recent experimental evidence and computer simulations have contradicted aspects of this classical model (3, 7-9), and the mechanism by which selection occurs in the GC has remained elusive. One of the challenges in studying GC selection has been a lack of knowledge about the dynamics of GC B cells in their complex physiological milieu. We developed a system to study the dynamics of GC B cells within intact mouse lymph nodes (LNs) by two-photon microscopy [the system is described in detail in the supporting online material (SOM) text] (10). In this system, 1 to 2% of GC B cells expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 1A and figs. S1 and S2) and by our measurements were able to undergo the normal processes of class switching, somatic hypermutation, and affinity maturation (figs. S3 and S4). The dynamics of GC B cell motility in explanted LNs were compared with two other B cell populations: (i) naive B cells (representing B cells before antigen encounter) in the follicular mantle that surrounds the GC and (ii) plasma cells (representing post-selected B cells that secrete antibodies) in the LN medulla (SOM text). GC B cells had highly dynamic shapes, extending dendritic processes resembling pseudopods as they moved (Fig. 1B and movie S1), whereas naive follicular mantle B cells and plasma cells exhibited a more round phenotype (Fig. 1B). Similar observations were made when GC and follicular mantle B cells were imaged by intravital microscopy of intact LNs (movie S2). Tracking analysis indicated that GC B cells were highly motile, similar to follicular mantle B cells, whereas plasma cells showed little motility (Fig. 1C; fig. S5, A to E; fig. S6; and movie S3). GC B cell motility was partially dependent on the chemokine CXCL13 (Fig. 1C and fig. S5) that is expressed by FDCs (SOM text) (11). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

The gridlines are separated by 20 1/2m. On average, GC B cells formed separate clusters from naive B cells in the follicular mantle (Fig. 1, A and D), giving the impression of distinct regions typically seen in static images, such as those obtained by immunohistochemistry (for an example, see fig. S2C). However, examination of the boundary between these regions revealed that the tracks of GC B cells and follicular mantle B cells were overlapping (Fig. 1D and movie S4), indicating that a physical boundary does not demarcate the GC and follicular mantle. Instead, the majority of cells turned after crossing from one region to the other, suggesting that the GC and follicular mantle are segregated by the responses of cells to attractive (or repulsive) cues. The behavior of cells in GC dark and light zones was examined by labeling light zone FDCs in vivo with immune complexes containing the fluorescent protein phycoerythrin (PE) (Fig. 2A and movie S5). B cells in dark and light zones were similarly motile (fig. S7). In 1 hour, most GC B cells appeared to stay within the dark or light zones, although a measurable proportion (5 to 8%) traveled along relatively straight paths from one zone to the other, covering substantial distances (Fig. 2, B and C, and movies S6 and S7). These observations extend previous conclusions based on fixed tissue analysis (1) that GCB cells migrate from the dark zone to the light zone and provide direct evidence that GC B cells return from the light zone to the dark zone. Within the light zone, FDC processes appeared to undulate, perhaps due to displacement by migrating GC B cells (movie S5). However, there was little evidence that GC B cells pause on FDC processes, in contrast to observations of the T cell-DC interactions in the T cell area (12). GC B cells in the light zone followed straighter paths than those in the dark zone (fig. S7, B and C), which may relate to the high concentration of CXCL13 on the FDC processes in the light zone (11). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

During time-lapse recordings, we occasionally observed cell division in both light zones (Fig. 3A) and dark zones (Fig. 3B), consistent with other studies that have questioned the classical model that proliferation only occurs in the dark zone (3, 8, 13). We further analyzed the relationship between GC B cell position and cell-cycle behavior by flow cytometry (SOM text), using surface abundance of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (Fig. 3C) as a marker to delineate cells in dark (CXCR4hi) and light (CXCR4lo) zones (11). Analysis of DNA content (Fig. 3D) revealed that a similar proportion of GC B cells were in S phase in both dark and light zones (Fig. 3E). A subset of cells was tracked over one complete cell cycle by pulse labeling with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analog that is incorporated into cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S phase) near the time of BrdU injection (14). A similar proportion of GC B cells in dark and light zones were labeled 30 min after BrdU injection; however, after 5 hours, at which time the cells had divided and returned to G1 phase, they accumulated in the dark zone but not in the light zone (Fig. 3, F and G; fig. S8; and fig. S9). These observations indicate that cells that divide in the light zone do not stay resident there-perhaps they return to the dark zone, exit the GC, or undergo apoptosis. From 5 to 12 hours after BrdU injection, the G1 phase cells that had accumulated in the dark zone began to appear in the light zone, suggesting that the light zone is replenished continuously by an influx of cells from the dark zone that recently completed a cell cycle (Fig. 3, F and G; fig. S8; and fig. S9). Cells were not seen reentering S phase until 12 hours after they were first labeled with BrdU in S phase (Fig. 3G and fig. S9, C and D), indicating that the average cell-cycle time is 12 hours or longer, rather than 6 to 7 hours as has been concluded in previous studies (1).

Similar data were obtained in splenic GCs in other experiments. GC B cells in (C) to (G) were gated as in fig. S9A. T cells are concentrated in the light zone (1), and T cell help is thought to be essential for GCs (3, 15). To understand the mode of B cell-T cell interaction in GCs, we visualized the interactions between GFP+ GC B cells and GC T cells expressing cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) (movie S8). Most contacts between GC B and T cells were of short duration (Fig. 4A), and only about 4% of GC B cell-T cell encounters led to the formation of stable conjugates, defined here as contacts lasting for more than 5 min (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, early in the immune response before GC formation, more than 50% of contacts between cognate antigen-specific B and T cells led to the formation of stable conjugates (Fig. 4C and movie S9) (16). Upon encounters leading to stable interactions with GC B cells, rapidly migrating GC T cells sharply decreased their motility to match B cell motility (Fig. 4D), and conjugates were led by B cells (movie S10), similar to the dynamics of stable B-T conjugates early in the immune response (16). The median velocity of GC T cells stably interacting with GFP+ B cells was below 10 1/2m/min (Fig. 4E). Only 32% of total GC T cells showed a median velocity below 10 1/2m/min (Fig. 4E), and the motility coefficient of GC T cells was greater than that of GC B cells (Fig. 4F and fig. S5E), strongly suggesting that the majority of T cells in GCs were not engaged in stable interactions with B cells. Our analyses suggest that each GC B cell encounters as many as 50 T cells per hour and that the majority of GC B cells are capable of binding antigen (fig. S3B). It thus seems likely that T cell help is limited, not only because there are fewer T cells than B cells, but also because of additional mechanisms suppressing stable B-T interactions in GCs.

Black bar segments indicate incomplete tracking as in (C). Scale bars, 10 1/2m. During the selection process in GCs, many GC B cells die and are visible by histology as "tingible bodies" inside macrophages (1). The cell bodies of dying GFP+ GC B cells were observed to undergo fragmentation (Fig. 4G), but surprisingly, this occurred outside of macrophages (movie S11). Blebs of dead GFP+ GC B cells appeared to be taken up by multiple macrophages (movie S11), although some blebs moved rapidly away from the original location of cell death, as if carried by motile cells (movie S2). Indeed, some GFP+ B cell blebs were attached to and carried by rapidly migrating CFP+ T cells (Fig. 4, H and I, and movie S12). All T cells that carried GFP+ B cell blebs had a median velocity greater than 10 1/2m/min (Fig. 4E), suggesting that they were not undergoing stable interactions with living B cells. The GFP+ GC B cells represent only about 1 to 2% of GC B cells, and we observed about 0.5% of T cells carrying GFP+ blebs; by extrapolation, at least one quarter of the GC T cells may be associated with one or more blebs from dead GC B cells. A higher frequency of bleb-T cell interactions were stable compared with live B cell-T cell interactions (Fig. 4, C and J), suggesting that these dead B cell fragments may affect the availability of T cell help in GCs. Our findings reveal that GC B cells are highly motile and exhibit a probing behavior as they travel over the antigen-bearing FDC network. The lack of GC B cell pausing suggests that the selection mechanism does not involve competition for adhesion to FDCs, whereas the rapid movement of B cells in close proximity to each other raises the possibility that high-affinity cells remove surface-bound antigen from lower-affinity cells. The observed migration of GC B cells from light to dark zones is consistent with GC B cells undergoing repeated rounds of mutation and selection within a given GC (17). Our estimate that GC B cells spend only several hours in the light zone suggests a limited amount of time to access helper T cells. Given that stable interactions of GC B cells with GC T cells were infrequent, it seems possible that T cell help is a limiting factor driving selection of higher-affinity B cell clones. In vitro studies have shown that T cells responding to antigen-presenting B cells can be sensitive to variations in the affinity of the B cell receptor across several orders of magnitude (18). We propose a selection model in which newly arising mutated GC B cells with higher affinity for antigen obtain and process greater amounts of antigen in a given period of time and then outcompete the surrounding B cells and B cell blebs for the attention of GC T cells.

We report that a synonymous SNP in the Multidrug Resistance 1 (MDR1) gene, part of a haplotype previously linked to altered function of the MDR1 gene product P-glycoprotein (P-gp), nonetheless results in P-gp with altered drug and inhibitor interactions. Similar mRNA and protein levels, but altered conformations, were found for wild-type and polymorphic P-gp. We hypothesize that the presence of a rare codon, marked by the synonymous polymorphism, affects the timing of cotranslational folding and insertion of P-gp into the membrane, thereby altering the structure of substrate and inhibitor interaction sites. The MDR1 gene product, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB1 or P-gp, is an ATP-driven efflux pump contributing to the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are P-gp substrates and to the multidrug resistance of cancer cells (1, 2). To date, more than 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported for MDR1 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/GeneGt.cgi?geneID=5243). One of these, a synonymous SNP in exon 26 (C3435T), was sometimes found to be associated with altered P-gp activity (3-6) and, when it appears in a haplotype, with reduced functionality (7). This association may be explained in different ways. Perhaps it is because C3435T is in linkage disequilibrium with other common functional nonsynonymous polymorphisms such as G2677T. In fact, the C1236T (a synonymous SNP), G2677T, and C3435T polymorphisms are part of a common haplotype (8, 9). Another possible explanation is that allele-specific differences in mRNA folding could influence splicing, processing, or translational control and regulation (10, 11). A third possibility is that the effect of the C3435T polymorphism on the levels of cell surface P-gp activity or its function is rather modest or drug-specific. Finally, numerous environmental factors are known to affect the expression and phenotypic activity of P-gp (12). To determine whether the C3435T polymorphism actually does affect P-gp activity, we expressed wild-type and polymorphic P-gps in HeLa cells with the use of a transient expression system (13). The same experiments were carried out on BSC-1 (epithelial cells of African green monkey kidney origin), Vero-76 (monkey kidney cells), and 12E1 (CEM human cells) cell lines (14), with similar results, indicating that this phenomenon is not specific to HeLa cells. Assays for P-gp's transport function with the fluorescent substrates Rhodamine 123 (Rh123), bodipy-FL-paclitaxel, bodipy-FL-verapamil, daunorubicin, bodipy-FL-vinblastine, and calcein-AM (14, 15) were performed on HeLa cells expressing the MDR1 wild-type; polymorphisms at C1236T, G2677T, or C3435T; and haplotypes consisting of these polymorphic variant combinations: C1236T-G2677T, C1236T-C3435T, G2677T-C3435T, and C1236T-G2677T-C3435T. The functions of P-gp for all single-polymorphism plasmids as well as for wild-type MDR1, as measured by intracellular accumulation or by efflux of fluorescent compounds, were not distinguishable under standard conditions (14). HeLa cells expressing double- and triple-haplotype mutants also revealed results similar to those for the single mutants (Fig. 1, A to C). However, the P-gp inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and verapamil (fig. S1) were less effective against all the substrates in cells expressing the double or triple haplotypes carrying C3435T relative to the wild type, the SNPs, or the haplotype that does not carry C3435T. Thus, it is not the presence of the nonsynonymous polymorphism G2677T that results in the phenotype, but rather the presence of C3435T in combination with one or two of the other polymorphisms.

We next tested to see whether these differences correlated with the concentrations of transduced plasmid DNA. The expression and function of all transduced cells were measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with MRK16 monoclonal antibody (mAb) staining and by Rh123 in the presence of CsA, respectively (14). The differences in inhibition by CsA and Rh123 between the cells expressing wild-type MDR1 and the haplotype C1236T-G2677T-C3435T were more distinct as the concentration of the DNA increased (Fig. 1, D to F). These data suggest that the differences were more pronounced at higher levels of mRNA where more P-gp was being translated in the cells. The expression levels of P-gp from the vaccinia infection/transfection system and cells of normal human adrenal glands were found to be comparable (fig. S2). Figure S1, C to E, shows that the haplotypes including C3435T had altered susceptibility to verapamil, but not to rapamycin (fig. S1F) (14). When the cells were incubated with the inhibitors before adding the fluorescent substrates, as opposed to simultaneous incubation with the drugs, the same pattern was observed. Bodipy-FL-verapamil, wild-type P-gp, and the haplotype (C1236T-G2677T-C3435T) exhibited different accumulations in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting a change in affinity (fig. S3). Synonymous SNPs or mutations can cause inactivation of the native splicing donor site, which results in a premature stop codon (16) or exon skipping, yielding a shorter mRNA. A previous report indicated that the polymorphism C3435T resulted in decreased levels of mRNA expression (17). We therefore compared mRNA levels (14) in the wild-type and haplotype (C1236T-G2677T-C3435T) with the use of real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which revealed equivalent mRNA levels (Fig. 2A). Western blots using C219 mAb showed comparable total cell expression of P-gp, and the infected/transfected cells expressed the same levels of P-gp as determined by FACS assays and immunohistochemical staining with MRK16 mAb (Fig. 2, B and C). This result was reproduced in different cell lines including BSC-1, Vero-76, and 12E1 (fig. S4). The complete amino acid sequence of MDR1 haplotype C1236T-G2677T-C3435T protein was identical to the predicted sequence.

(D) Immunoblot analysis of pTM1 only, wild-type MDR1, and the haplotype C1236T-G2677T-C3435T (2 1/2g protein/lane) with C219 mAb (14). The mature fully glycosylated (1/2170 kD) andimmatureP-gpbands (1/2150kD) are marked by arrows (19). We hypothesized that a conformation difference between wild-type and haplotype P-gp might explain these results. Indeed, UIC2 (14), a conformation-sensitive mAb, alone or in combination with CsA or vinblastine at 37C, revealed pronounced differences in binding consistent with altered conformations in the haplotype (fig. S5) (18). To determine whether there are subtle differences in the folding of wild-type and haplotype P-gp, we compared their relative susceptibility to trypsin. Figure 3 shows the disappearance of the P-gp band as a function of trypsin concentration. The concentration required for 50% degradation (IC50, here expressed as 1/2g trypsin) was greater for haplotype P-gp than for wild-type P-gp by a factor of about 3.4; this result implies that the two have slightly different tertiary structures. Both wild-type and haplotype P-gps had comparable IC50 (1/2g trypsin) values in the presence of verapamil, which suggests that the altered conformation can be corrected by drug interaction with P-gp. The immature, coreglycosylated form of P-gp (150-kD band) was more sensitive to trypsin than the mature, glycosylated form, consistent with (19), by a factor of 5. However, the ratios (wild-type:haplotype) of the IC50 (1/2g trypsin) values were comparable for the mature and immature bands (3.86 1/2g versus 4.4 1/2g). Thus, it is unlikely that altered glycosylation is responsible for the functional differences observed. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

Crude membranes prepared from vTF7-3 infected/transfected HeLa cells expressing wild-type MDR1 or the haplotype C1236T-G2677T-C3435T were treated with increasing concentrations of trypsin and the disappearance of the P-gp band was quantified as described above. (A) Experiment performed in the absence of verapamil; IC50 =2.1 1/2g (wild type), 7.1 1/2g (C1236T-G2677T-C3435T).

(B) Same experiment in the presence of 30 1/2M verapamil; IC50 = 3.7 1/2g (wild type), 3.3 1/2g (C1236T-G2677T-C3435T). Values for the mature and immature P-gp bands: IC50 = 2.5 1/2g (wild-type immature), 2.5 1/2g (haplotype immature), 3.6 1/2g (wild-typemature), 3.2 1/2g (haplotype mature). Immunoblots with C219 mAb are shown at the bottom. The use of rare codons appears to influence the translation rate, which in turn affects protein folding (20-25), with the third base in the codon having the largest effect (26). We hypothesize that as the cell produces more P-gp (Fig. 1, D to F), the role of codon usage may become more critical when certain tRNA species become depleted. The codon usage for the SNP at position 12/1236 with GGC changed to GGT (both encode Gly) changes from 34% [relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), 22.4] to 16% (RSCU, 10.8). The SNP at position 21/2677 that changes GCT (Ala) to TCT (Ser) also uses a less common codon (26% to 18%; RSCU values change from 18.5 to 15.1). The SNP at position 26/3435 that changes the codon from ATC (Ile) to ATT (Ile) reduces the codon usage from 47% to 35% (RSCU values change from 20.9 to 15.8). Clusters of rare codon usage (table S1) occur both upstream and downstream of each of these SNPs. Codon usage rates are similar in humans and monkeys, which explains the similarity in the results with all transduced cells (27). To test whether codon usage compromises P-gp function, we introduced C3435A (isoleucine codon usage for ATA is 18%, RSCU 7.4) to produce the haplotype C1236T-G2677T-C3435A. Functional assays using bodipy-verapamil or Rh123 in the presence of digoxin (Fig. 4, A and B) showed even larger decreases in inhibitor effects between this haplotype and the common haplotype C1236T-G2677T-C3435T. Moreover, use of Rh123 in the presence of fexofenadine revealed median fluorescence of 26.9 for the wild type, 24.3 for C1236T-G2677T-C3435T, and 20.3 for C1236T-G2677T-C3435A. The median fluorescence in the presence of paclitaxel and fexofenadine was 38.2 for the wild type, 28.6 for C1236T-G2677T-C3435T, and 22.9 for C1236T-G2677T-C3435A.

The amino acid sequence of proteins is generally believed to determine protein expression, folding, and function; mutations that alter the primary structure of a protein can affect these properties. The important question addressed by this study is the role of silent mutations (i.e., those that do not affect amino acid sequence) in protein folding and function. Recent theoretical studies have suggested that codon usage is not random, and experimental studies in prokaryotes suggest that this may be so (28). Here we show that a silent mutation in a complex, mammalian membrane transport protein alters the substrate specificity. We hypothesize that when frequent codons are changed to rare codons in a cluster of infrequently used codons, the timing of cotranslational folding is affected (29) and may result in altered function. This finding may be clinically important. For example, mutations in the MRP6 (ABCC6) gene cause the disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum, but missense and nonsense mutations are found in only about 60% of cases (30), raising the possibility that mutations that do not change coding sequence may contribute to disease by a similar mechanism.
Abstract Adult stem cells often divide asymmetrically to produce one self-renewed stem cell and one differentiating cell, thus maintaining both populations. The asymmetric outcome of stem cell divisions can be specified by an oriented spindle and local self-renewal signals from the stem cell niche. Here we show that developmentally programmed asymmetric behavior and inheritance of mother and daughter centrosomes underlies the stereotyped spindle orientation and asymmetric outcome of stem cell divisions in the Drosophila male germ line. The mother centrosome remains anchored near the niche while the daughter centrosome migrates to the opposite side of the cell before spindle formation. Adult stem cells maintain populations of highly differentiated but short-lived cells throughout the life of the organism. To maintain the critical balance between stem cell and differentiating cell populations, stem cells have a potential to divide asymmetrically, producing one stem and one differentiating cell (1). The asymmetric outcome of stem cell divisions can be specified by regulated spindle orientation, such that the two daughter cells are placed in different microenvironments that either specify stem cell identity (stem cell niche) or allow differentiation (2, 3). Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSCs) are maintained through attachment to somatic hub cells, which constitute the stem cell niche. Hub cells secrete the signaling ligand Upd, which activates the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway in the neighboring germ cells to specify stem cell identity (4, 5). Drosophila male GSCs normally divide asymmetrically, producing one stem cell, which remains attached to the hub, and one gonialblast, which initiates differentiation. This stereotyped asymmetric outcome is controlled by the orientation of the mitotic spindle in GSCs: The spindle lies perpendicular to the hub so that one daughter cell inherits the attachment to the hub, whereas the other is displaced away (6). The stereotyped orientation of the mitotic spindle is set up by the positioning of centrosomes during interphase (Fig. 1A) (6). GSCs remain oriented toward the niche throughout the cell cycle. In G1 phase, the single centrosome is located near the interface with the hub. When the duplicated centrosomes separate in G2 phase, one stays next to the hub, whereas the other migrates to the opposite side of the cell. Centrosomes in the GSCs separate unusually early in interphase, rather than at the G2-prophase transition, so it is common to see GSCs with fully separated centrosomes without a spindle (of >500 GSCs in the 0- to 3-day-old males counted, 1/240% of the GSCs had two centrosomes that were separated to opposite sides of the cell, but no spindle was yet assembled) (6).

(B) Pulse-chase strategy to label the daughter centrosome. Each centrosome (circle) contains two centrioles (ovals numbered in order of generation). Transient expression of GFP-PACT labels newly assembled centrioles (3). In the first cell cycle after the GFP-PACT pulse, both the mother (1+3) and daughter (2+3) centrosomes are GFP-positive.

(C and D) Testis tips with labeled GSCs (dotted outline) in the G2 phase of the first cell cycle after the GFP-PACT pulse [(C), 12 hours after heat shock] or the second cell cycle [(D), 24 hours after heat shock].

Blue, GSCs in the first cell cycle (two labeled, oriented centrosomes); red, GSCs in the second cell cycle (one labeled and one unlabeled centrosome) with the labeled (daughter) centrosome distal from the hub. Rarely observed outcomes were pink, the first cell cycle, with neither centrosome next to the hub; black, the second cell cycle, with the mother centrosome distal to the hub; green, the second cell cycle, with neither centrosome next to the hub. Only those GSCs that had two centrosomes, with one or both centrosomes labeled with GFP-PACT, were counted. Differences between the mother and daughter centrosomes underlie the stereotyped behavior of the centrosomes in Drosophila male GSCs. The mother centrosome normally remains anchored to the hub-GSC interface and is inherited by the GSC, whereas the daughter centrosome moves away from the hub and is inherited by the cell that commits to differentiation. Mother and daughter centrosomes were differentially labeled by transient expression of green fluorescent protein-pericentrin/AKAP450 C-terminus (GFP-PACT) from the Drosophila pericentrin-like protein (7) under heat shock-Gal4 control (8). The PACT domain, which is necessary and sufficient for centriolar localization, is incorporated into centrioles only during centrosome duplication and does not exchange with the cytoplasmic pool (7). Both the mother and daughter centrosomes are labeled by GFP-PACT in the first cell cycle after heat shock (Fig. 1B). In the second cell cycle, the daughter centrosome retains GFP-PACT, whereas the mother centrosome is not labeled, thus distinguishing the mother and daughter centrosomes (Fig. 1B). After a short burst of GFP-PACT expression induced by a 2.5-hour heat shock, 20 to 30% of the GSCs had GFP-labeled centrosomes, indicating the duplication of centrosomes during the window of GFP-PACT expression. By 12 hours after heat shock, >90% of the labeled GSCs had two GFP-positive centrosomes, indicating that they had progressed to the G2 phase of the first cell cycle after GFP-PACT incorporation (Fig. 1, C and E). By 18 to 24 hours after heat shock, the number of GSCs with two GFP-positive centrosomes had decreased, whereas the number of GSCs with one GFP-positive and one GFP-negative centrosome had increased, suggesting progression into the second cell cycle. Generally, the centrosome distal to the hub was labeled, whereas the centrosome proximal to the hub was GFP-negative (>95% of GSCs in the second cell cycle) (Fig. 1, D and E), indicating that the daughter centrosomes migrate away from the hub-GSC interface during asymmetric GSC divisions. Labeling the mother rather than the daughter centrosomes confirmed that the male GSCs in the niche preferentially retain mother centrosomes over time. Centrioles assembled during early embryogenesis were labeled using the NGT40 Gal4 driver to drive the expression of GFP-PACT in blastoderm-stage embryos, shutting off after germband extension (9). In the first cell cycle after the depletion of the cytoplasmic pool of GFP-PACT in the GSCs, both the mother and daughter centrosomes should be labeled. In subsequent cell cycles, only the mother centrosomes should be labeled (Fig. 2A). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

Green column, GSCs that still had cytoplasmic GFP-PACT. Only 50 to 60% of the total male GSCs were labeled by NGT40/GFP-PACT. The remaining 40 to 50% could contain mother centrioles assembled in early embryogenesis before GFP-PACT expression. Only those GSCs that had two centrosomes, with one or both centrosomes labeled with GFP-PACT, were counted. N, number of GSCs scored per time point. In most GSCs in the second or later cell cycle after the depletion of cytoplasmic GFP-PACT, the labeled centrosome was positioned next to the hub-GSC interface, and the unlabeled centrosome had moved away from the hub (Fig. 2, B and C). The frequency of GSCs that had the proximal, but not distal, centrosome labeled remained constant over time for 10 days (L3 larvae to day-3 adults), suggesting that the mother centrosomes are reliably retained by the GSCs, even through multiple rounds of GSC divisions. Some GSCs maintained cytoplasmic GFP-PACT, especially in L3 larvae, suggesting that the GFP-PACT had not yet been diluted out (Fig. 2C, green column). We also observed some GSCs with two labeled centrosomes, suggesting that they are in the first cell cycle after the depletion of cytoplasmic GFP-PACT (Fig. 2C, red columns). The mother centrosomes in GSCs appeared to maintain robust interphase microtubule arrays. Ultrastructural analysis of the GSCs revealed that the centrosome proximal to the hub was commonly associated with many microtubules throughout the cell cycle. Nineteen centrosomes in GSCs were scored in serial sections of the apical tips of five wild-type testes. Eleven centrosomes were localized close to the adherens junctions between the hub and the GSCs. Nine of these proximal centrosomes appeared to be in interphase cells, based on nuclear morphology and microtubule arrangement. Typically, these interphase centrosomes proximal to the hub were associated with numerous microtubules (Fig. 3A and fig. S1A). In some samples, microtubules appeared to extend from the centrosome toward the adherens junctions (Fig. 3A', arrowheads). The other two proximal centrosomes appeared to be in cells in mitotic prophase (fig. S1B), based on their robust microtubule arrays containing bundled microtubules running parallel to or piercing the nuclear surface. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

In contrast, of the five distal centrosomes in the apparently interphase cells that were scored, four had few associated microtubules (Fig. 3B and fig. S1C). The remaining three distal centrosomes appeared to be in cells in mitotic prophase, based on microtubule arrays containing bundled microtubules (fig. S1D). Thus, the mother centrosomes may maintain interphase microtubule arrays that anchor them to the hub-GSC interface, whereas the daughter centrosomes may initially have few associated microtubules and be free to move, establishing a robust microtubule array only later in the cell cycle. Consistent with the idea that astral microtubules anchor the mother centrosomes to the hub-GSC interface, motherversus daughter-centrosome positioning was randomized in GSCs that were homozygous mutant for centrosomin (cnn) (8), an integral centrosomal protein required to anchor astral microtubules to centrosomes (10-12). Analysis of mother and daughter centrosomes after transient expression of GFP-PACT revealed that, for cnn homozygous mutant GSCs where one of the two centrosomes was positioned next to the hub, it was essentially random whether the mother or the daughter centrosome stayed next to the hub (Fig. 4). In addition, in >25% of total labeled GSCs, neither of the two centrosomes was next to the hub, which is consistent with our previous observations (Fig. 4) (6).

Our results indicate that the two centrosomes in Drosophila male GSCs have different characters and fates. The mother centrosome stays next to the junction with the niche and is inherited by the cell that self-renews stem cell fate. Thus, GSCs can maintain an old centriole assembled many cell generations earlier. In contrast, the daughter centrosome migrates away from the niche and is inherited by the cell that will initiate differentiation. We postulate that the mother centrosomes in male GSCs may remain anchored to the GSC-niche interface throughout the cell cycle by attachment to astral microtubules connected to the adherens junction, whereas the daughter centrosomes may initially have few associated microtubules and thus can move away from the niche. Microtubule-dependent differential segregation of mother and daughter spindle-pole bodies (equivalent to centrosomes in higher organisms) is observed in budding yeast (13). In cultured vertebrate cells, the centrioles mature slowly over the cell cycle, and the mother centrosomes (containing a mature centriole) attach astral microtubules more effectively and are more stationary than daughter centrosomes in interphase (14). The unusually early separation of centrosomes in interphase male GSCs may provide a way to move the daughter centrosome out of range of the stabilizing influence of the adherens junction complex before it becomes competent to hold a robust microtubule array. Developmentally programmed anchoring of the mother centrosome may provide a key mechanism to ensure the stereotyped orientation of the mitotic spindle and thus the reliably asymmetric outcome of the male GSC divisions. Although it is tempting to speculate that determinants associated with the mother or daughter centrosome may play a role in specifying stem cell or differentiating-cell fates, such determinants are yet to be identified. Rather, the asymmetric inheritance of mother and daughter centrosomes in male GSCs may be a consequence of the cytoskeletal mechanisms that are imposed as part of the stem cell program to anchor one centrosome next to the niche throughout the interphase, ensuring a properly oriented spindle.
Abstract We report on the very-low-frequency earthquakes occurring in the transition zone of the subducting plate interface along the Nankai subduction zone in southwest Japan. Seismic waves generated by very-low-frequency earthquakes with seismic moment magnitudes of 3.1 to 3.5 predominantly show a long period of about 20 seconds. The seismicity of very-low-frequency earthquakes accompanies and migrates with the activity of deep low-frequency tremors and slow slip events. The coincidence of these three phenomena improves the detection and characterization of slow earthquakes, which are thought to increase the stress on updip megathrust earthquake rupture zones. Nonvolcanic deep low-frequency (1) tremors and slow slip events (2-4) occur simultaneously in the transition zone (5) from locked to aseismic slips at the downdip portion of the Nankai subduction zone in southwest Japan. Megathrust earthquakes with seismic moment magnitudes exceeding 8 occur in this region periodically on 1/2100-year time scales (6). There is also a large gap in the source time properties of two recently discovered mechanisms of relaxation of accumulated stress in the transition zone: Deep low-frequency tremors (1) predominantly show frequencies near 0.5 s, suggesting that the characteristic time scale of the rupture duration is on the order of 1 s, whereas slow slip events (2-4) do not radiate any seismic waves and cause crustal deformations that continue for 2 to 5 days. Deep low-frequency tremors and slow slip events in Japan have been detected by the seismic network of the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED), which comprises a network of 1/2750 high-sensitivity seismograph network (Hi-net) and 73 broadband seismograph network (F-net) stations (7). The Hi-net stations provide a high-level detectability for deep low-frequency tremors with small-amplitude signals (1). The Hi-net and F-net stations also detect very-low-frequency (VLF) earthquakes within the accretionary prism at the updip portion of the Nankai subduction zone (8-10). A two-component high-sensitivity horizontal accelerometer with a wide frequency response range from 5 Hz to direct-current component (Hi-net TILT) is installed at each Hi-net station (11). The accelerometers function as tiltmeters; they are useful in analyzing short-term slow slip events (2-4). Hi-net TILT and F-net are also useful in calculating the moment tensor solution of local earthquakes (12). To understand the stress-relaxation process in the transition zone, it is important to identify all seismic and geodetic phenomena. At present, a large gap exists between the characteristic time scales for the previously identified deep low-frequency tremors and those for slow slip events. We examined the Hi-net and F-net data with the use of various bandpass filters within an overall range of 1 to 0.005Hz in an effort to detect unidentified long-period seismic signals radiated from the transition zone. With a bandpass filter of 0.02 to 0.05 Hz, we succeed in detecting distinct, anomalous VLF signals radiated from the transition zone near the source region of deep low-frequency tremors. These signals, observed at several Hi-net TILT and F-net stations, are best identified on the radial and vertical components. The VLF signals (Fig. 1) are accompanied by wave trains of deep low-frequency tremors. The apparent velocity estimated from their arrival times at stations with an epicentral distance exceeding 50 km is 1/26 km/s, which overlaps with P-wave velocities in this region. This value suggests that the observed VLF signals constitute body waves. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Sample seismograms of a VLF earthquake at selected sites. Radial components at seven Hi-net TILT stations are shown. The observed waveforms are arranged in epicentral distance order from an estimated source location. The red and black traces represent the observed waveforms filtered for bands of 0.02 to 0.05 Hz and 2 to 8 Hz, respectively. The vertical bars on the right indicate the displacement amplitudes. To detect VLF seismic signals and estimate their hypocenters systematically, we adopted the grid moment tensor inversion (GMTI) approach (13-15), in which we assume that the target earthquake always occurs at a grid point that is arranged with respect to both space and time. Using this approach and continuous seismograms obtained from F-net, we calculated the point source moment tensor solution at 0.1 horizontal, 3 km depth, and 1 s interval grid-point spacing (fig. S1). First, we removed time periods that are potentially contaminated with seismic waves from teleseismic and ordinary regional earthquakes from all the GMTI solutions. Next, using the F-net and Hi-net TILT data, we applied the centroid moment tensor inversion (CMTI) approach (12, 15)-in which hypocenters and fault mechanisms of the target earthquakes are calculated simultaneously-to the remaining GMTI solutions. We detected many VLF seismic events coincident with the deep low-frequency tremors and slow slip events that occurred from January to May 2006 (table S1). These VLF events with seismic moment magnitudes of 3.1 to 3.5 are located on the belt-like distribution of deep low-frequency tremors along the strike of the subducting Philippine Sea plate (Fig. 2). Local ordinary earthquakes with the same seismic moment magnitude as these VLF events are not listed in any seismic catalog. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

The plus and diamond symbols represent the NIED Hi-net and F-net stations, respectively. The depth contour indicates the upper surface of the Philippine Sea plate. The rectangle indicates the area shown in Fig. 3. The yellow triangle indicates the epicenter of an ordinary earthquake with a moment magnitude of 3.4. We compared a waveform of the VLF event with that of an ordinary earthquake at the F-net station UMJ (fig. S2). Both events have the same moment magnitude of 3.4 and almost identical epicentral distance and depth. Both events have low-frequency components with similar amplitudes in the range of 0.02 to 0.05 Hz. However, the signal of a VLF event does not constitute any high-frequency components in the range of 2 to 8 Hz. This result suggests another type of slow earthquake, which we call a VLF earthquake. Earthquakes with similar discrepancies between amplitudes measured at low and high frequencies are observed on transform faults and are identified as slow earthquakes (16). The observed waveforms of VLF earthquakes are explained by thrust faulting (Fig. 2 and fig. S3). The epicenters of VLF earthquakes are confined to a narrow band bound by the surface projection of 30- to 35-km depth contours of the plate interface (Fig. 2). Moreover, their epicenters clearly overlap with the seismicity of deep low-frequency tremors. The depths of the plate interface are based on the result of the depth variation of the oceanic Mohorovicic discontinuity (the crust-mantle boundary) calculated by receiver function analysis (17). The thickness of the oceanic crust in this region is assumed to be 1/25 km according to an active-source seismic experiment (18). The focal depths of VLF earthquakes are distributed across slightly wider ranges (fig. S4); the averaged depths and standard deviations are 40 8 km and 35 9 km in the Kii-Tokai and Shikoku regions, respectively. This wide depth range can be attributed to the depth variation with a broad peak of variance reduction calculated by CMTI (fig. S5), which suggests that the focal depth is not well constrained. However, these focal depths are roughly consistent with the subducting plate interface. The dip angles of the nodal planes dipping landward are consistent with the slope of the Philippine Sea plate; the averaged dip angles and standard deviations are 14 8 in the Kii-Tokai region and 15 9 in the Shikoku region. These values imply that VLF earthquakes may occur on the subducting plate interface. The simultaneous occurrence of deep low-frequency tremors and slow slip events has been observed in southwest Japan (2). These activities are coincident both spatially and temporally, and they exhibit a clear migration pattern when the activity of deep low-frequency tremors is high (4). A clear northeastward migration of the seismicity of deep low-frequency tremors and geodetic deformations by a slow slip event were observed in the Kii-Tokai region in January 2006 (19). Concurrently, an identical migration of the seismicity of VLF earthquakes was observed in the same region (Fig. 3). The migration pattern of VLF earthquake seismicity is consistent with both the deep low-frequency tremor activity and the observation of the geodetic deformations. This observation indicates a close relationship between slow slip events and the activity of both VLF earthquakes and deep low-frequency tremors, thereby reflecting the stress accumulation and relaxation process in the transition zone.

Migration of seismicity of both VLF earthquakes and deep low-frequency tremors, and tilt change at four Hi-net stations-OKZH, HAZH, URSH, and MGWH-between 5 January and 25 January 2006. The temporal variation of VLF earthquakes (red stars) and deep low-frequency tremors (circles) is shown along the southwest-northeast line in the inset representing the strike of the subducting plate interface. The four colored lines are records of the east-west component of the tilt changes observed at Hi-net stations. The inset shows the distribution of the VLF earthquakes and deep low-frequency tremors during the same period, as well as the Hi-net TILT station locations (plus symbols). The excitations of wave trains caused by VLF earthquakes appear to always overlap with the peak amplitude of wave trains caused by deep low-frequency tremors (Fig. 1). However, it should be noted that deep low-frequency tremors occur without the excitation of VLF earthquakes. This result suggests that the VLF event and the deep low-frequency tremors are two distinct phenomena. Considering the predominance of VLF components of 1/220 s (Fig. 1 and fig. S2), their response to the rupture process may correspond to a slow earthquake with a characteristic time scale of rupture duration on the order of 10 s. This rupture duration is longer than that of ordinary earthquakes and also exceeds the duration proposed for deep low-frequency tremors, 1/21 s (1). However, this 10-s duration is obviously shorter than the 2- to 5-day duration of regionally observed slow slip events (2-4). Similar VLF earthquakes that occur within the accretionary prism are thought to represent slow earthquakes with low stress drops, low rupture velocities, and low slip velocities on the fault plane with high pore-fluid pressure (10). These observations suggest that three types of slow earthquakes-deep low-frequency tremors, VLF earthquakes, and slow slip events-occur simultaneously in the transition zone of the subducting plate interface. Tomography studies that image seismic velocity structure show that a high Poisson's ratio exists around the source region of the deep low-frequency tremor (20). A recent precise study in the Nankai subduction zone proposes a linear distribution of low-frequency earthquakes, similar to the classification of deep low-frequency tremors with slightly obvious P and S phases, at 35 to 40 km around the plate interface and corresponding to a zone of high Poisson's ratio in the vicinity of the transition zone. This suggests the following two interpretations: (i) generation of low-frequency earthquakes by shear slip, and (ii) formation of a region of high pore-fluid pressure due to the fluid released from the dehydration of the subducted oceanic crust (21). Considering that three types of slow earthquakes including low-frequency earthquakes occur in the transition zone (Fig. 4), the existence of a zone of high pore-fluid pressure may play an important role in the occurrence of these slow earthquakes. One possible scenario of the stress-relaxation process in the transition zone is based on an asperity model (22, 23), in which stronger coupled patches of VLF earthquakes are surrounded by aseismic slow slip regions. The fault shear strength of the slow slip segment is weaker than that of the asperity of a megathrust earthquake because the high pore-fluid pressure causes a reduction in the normal stress on the plate interface. If the shear stress loaded by the subducting plate reaches the yield stress of the bulk for the slow slip segment, the slow slip event starts in the transition zone. When the shear stress increases on the patches of VLF earthquakes due to the occurrence of the slow slip event, these patches eventually rupture after the cumulative stress reaches the yield stress reduced by the high pore-fluid pressure. This rupture results in a low stress drop and possibly induces the behavior of a VLF earthquake. Many new microcracks, with shear strength weaker than that of ordinary microearthquakes and source size smaller than that of VLF earthquakes, may rupture in the transition zone as a result of the local stress change around the plate interface, induced by the migration slow slip. The superposition of a seismic signal from each small failure yields the observed sequence of deep low-frequency tremors. Low-frequency tremors in the Cascadia subduction zone have an extensive depth distribution from 10 to 40 km, where there are strong seismic refractors, suggesting the existence of fluid (24). These tremors also may be caused by the stress change outside the transition zone due to a slow slip event, because a similar migration of the tremor seismicity and slow slip is observed in the Cascadia subduction zone (25).

Schematic of the seismic source distribution for VLF earthquakes, deep low-frequency tremors, and slow slip events at the downdip portion of the subduction zone in southwest Japan. The monitoring of not only deep low-frequency tremors but also VLF earthquakes may be useful to assess the stress on the rupture zone of a megathrust earthquake. This is because the shear stress on the asperity of the megathrust earthquake may increase as a result of slow earthquakes of all sizes occurring at the downdip portion of the subduction zone. VLF earthquakes are also useful indicators for estimating the stress condition of the rupture zone of an anticipated megathrust earthquake.
Abstract The slow rate of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is the main limitation for automotive applications. We demonstrated that the Pt3Ni(111) surface is 10-fold more active for the ORR than the corresponding Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than the current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts for PEMFC. The Pt3Ni(111) surface has an unusual electronic structure (d-band center position) and arrangement of surface atoms in the near-surface region. Under operating conditions relevant to fuel cells, its near-surface layer exhibits a highly structured compositional oscillation in the outermost and third layers, which are Pt-rich, and in the second atomic layer, which is Ni-rich. The weak interaction between the Pt surface atoms and nonreactive oxygenated species increases the number of active sites for O2 adsorption. When a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is used in a demanding application such as an automobile, it must overcome the kinetic limitations on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which have led to three fundamental problems (1-5). First, the substantial overpotential for the ORR (6-10) at practical operating current densities reduces the thermal efficiency well below the thermodynamic limits, typically to about 43% at 0.7 V [versus the theoretical thermal efficiency of 83% at the reversible potential for the ORR (1.23 V)]. Second, an approximately five-fold reduction of the amount of Pt (platinum-loading) in current PEMFC stacks is needed to meet the cost requirements for large-scale automotive applications (10). Finally, the dissolution and/or loss of Pt surface area in the cathode must be greatly reduced. These limitations could be eliminated if stable cathode catalysts, with an order of magnitude increase in the specific activity over that of state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts, can be developed (10). In the hope that a combination of different metals would have improved catalytic activity and stability relative to those of a pure metal, the ORR has been studied on numerous bi- or multimetallic alloys (6, 8, 11-17). These studies have led to incremental improvements to catalyst performance, but large increases in activity have yet to be realized. Rather than use a trial-and-error or combinatorial approach, we have examined selected cathode materials with well-characterized surfaces so that the mechanism of action can be attributed to a specific property (at the atomic and molecular level) of the surface under study. In this way, we can determine (i) whether the kinetics of the ORR are structure-sensitive, (ii) the composition of the topmost surface atomic layers (the segregation profile), and (iii) how alloying [usually described in terms of the ligand effect or/and ensemble effect (18-20)] alters the chemical properties of the surfaces. Similar approaches are commonly used in gas-phase catalysis (21) under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and near-ambient conditions, but alloy surface chemistry on single-crystal surfaces at electrochemical interfaces is relatively unexplored. These aqueous interfaces are more complex in that they necessarily contain solvent and electronic/ionic charge, and (experimentally) it is very challenging but still tractable to use in situ surface-sensitive methods to characterize potential-induced changes in the surface properties and reactivity. We have used a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the ORR on Pt3Ni(hkl) single-crystal surfaces, identify which surface properties govern the variations in reactivity of PtNi catalysts, and determine how surface structures, surface segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect the ORR kinetics. Well-characterized PtNi single-crystal electrode surfaces were formed and characterized with UHV methods for surface preparation and surface analysis. These surfaces were transferred into the electrochemical environment without airborne contamination, and the stability of the UHV-prepared surface was determined with a combination of in situ surface-sensitive probes with electrochemical methods so that activity relationships could be obtained in real time. The results of the preparation and characterization of Pt3Ni(hkl) alloy surfaces in UHV are summarized in Fig. 1. The surface-sensitive techniques that were used included low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and synchrotron-based high-resolution ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) (see methods in the supporting online material). Each of these methods has certain advantages, and they yield complementary information. The surface symmetry obtained from LEED analysis shows that, whereas the Pt3Ni(111) surface exhibits a (1 * 1) pattern (Fig. 1D) (i.e., that of the bulk termination), the atomically less dense Pt3Ni(100) surface shows a (1 * 5) reconstruction pattern (the so-called "hex" phase) in both the [011] and [01-1] directions (Fig. 1E). Analysis of the Pt3Ni(110) LEED data (Fig. 1F) indicates that this surface may exhibit a mixture of (1 * 1) and (1 * 2) periodicities, the latter being known as the (1 * 2) missing-row structure (22).

The composition of the outermost atomic layer was obtained with LEIS, as previously shown for Pt3Ni polycrystalline alloys (15, 23); after a final anneal, the surface atomic layer of all three Pt3Ni(hkl) crystals is pure Pt (Fig. 1B) [i.e., all form the so-called Pt-skin structures (17, 20)]. Previous studies of PtNi single-crystal surfaces in UHV had indicated that this surface enrichment of Pt in the first layer is counterbalanced by its depletion in the next two to three atomic layers, so that the concentration profile oscillates around the bulk value (24, 25). We demonstrated that segregation-driven near-surface compositional changes result in distinctive electronic properties of the PtNi (hkl) alloys. The surface electronic structures were obtained from the background-corrected UPS spectra (26). As summarized in Fig. 1C, the d-band density of states (DOS) is structure-sensitive, and the position of the d-band center shifts from -2.70 eVon Pt3Ni(110) to -3.10 eVon Pt3Ni(111) to -3.14 eV on Pt3Ni(100). Furthermore, the DOS of the alloy surfaces is quite different from that of corresponding pure Pt single crystals; that is, on the (110), (100), and (111) alloy surfaces, the d-band center is downshifted by about 0.16, 0.24, and 0.34 eV, respectively. An important yet largely unexplored issue in surface electrochemistry on alloys is understanding how chemisorption energies correlate with the average energy of the d-state on the surface atoms to which the adsorbate binds (i.e., the ligand effect). To do this, we compared the results on the (111) surfaces with the same composition and arrangement of surface atoms but with a different d-band center position. Although we are highlighting how the difference between the electronic surface structures of Pt(111) and Pt3Ni(111) can affect the adsorption of spectator species and the kinetics of the ORR, the findings are generally applicable to other single-crystal alloy surfaces. We next determined the stability of a surface after transfer from UHV into the electrochemical environment. Surface x-ray scattering (SXS) was used to characterize both the potential range of stability as well as the near-surface composition of the alloy in situ. Only results for Pt3Ni(111) are presented because they provide the most useful information about the potential-induced changes in the surface structure and segregation profile; a brief description of results for (110) and (100) can be found in (27). The termination of the Pt3Ni(111) lattice at the surface in terms of elemental composition and surface relaxation was determined by measurement and analysis of the crystal truncation rods (CTRs) (28). Pt3Ni(111) has the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice with random occupation of sites by Pt and Ni, and this lattice gives rise to SXS similar to that obtained from a monocrystalline fcc lattice. Sensitivity to atomic layer composition is enhanced by the use of anomalous x-ray scattering techniques in which the incident x-ray energy is tuned to an atomic adsorption edge of the material (29). Thus, from SXS, we obtained information about the positions and compositions, both in the surface and subsurface layers. The CTR analysis shows that, at 0.05 V, the first layer is composed entirely of Pt and, whereas the second atomic layer is Ni-rich (52% of Ni as compared to 25% of Ni in the bulk), the third layer is again Pt-enriched (87%) (Fig. 2A). Having determined the near-surface structure at 0.05 V, the potential was cycled while the scattered x-ray intensity was measured at a CTR position that is sensitive to surface relaxation and surface roughness (Fig. 2A). We find that both the Pt3Ni(111) surface structure as well as the segregation profile are completely stable over this potential range because the changes in the x-ray scattering signal are fully reversible, and we find that the decrease in intensity at positive potential is consistent with an inward relaxation (contraction) of the surface atomic layer (this result is confirmed by similar measurements at other reciprocal lattice positions). The contraction of Pt surface atoms is induced by the adsorption of oxygenated species, which is determined by the Ni-induced modification of the Pt-skin electronic structure. A direct consequence of contraction of the topmost layer of Pt-skin at the potentials higher than 0.8 V is the increased stability of this surface over corresponding pure Pt(111), which was additionally confirmed by prolonged cycling in the designated potential range.

The relations between the surface electronic properties and the potential-dependent surface coverage by adsorbing species (the adsorption isotherms in Fig. 2C) were established by comparing the experimentally determined position of the d-band centers to the fractional coverages of adsorbed hydrogen (H+ +e- = Hupd, where Hupd refers to the underpotentially deposited hydrogen) between 0.05 0.15 V) in Hupd formation and positive shift (0.1 V) in OHad formation occurred relative to Pt(111). In agreement with the onset of adsorption, on Pt3Ni(111), the fractional coverages by Hupd and OHad (Hupd and OHad) were dramatically reduced by 50% relative to Pt(111), which is in agreement with the large downshift (0.34 eV) of the d-band center position on the Pt-skin structure. As shown in Fig. 1, H and I, similar changes occurred for the other two single-crystal surfaces. On the Pt(100)-skin, Hupd was reduced by 15% relative to Pt(100), and OHad was reduced by 25%. On Pt3Ni(110), small but clearly discernable decreases in Hupd (10%) and the fractional coverage by OHad (OH) (20%) were observed relative to Pt(110). To describe these effects quantitatively, we performed DFT calculations, using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set, on the adsorption of OH and H2O at 0.25 monolayer coverage on modeled Pt(111) surfaces, with second atomic layers containing 0 or 50% Ni atoms. In acid solutions, OHad would react with H+ and form H2O on the catalyst surface. The change in the reversible potential U of the above reaction on Pt(111) resulting from sublayer Ni atoms is (1) Here, Eads(OH)Pt, Eads(H2O)Pt, Eads(OH)PtNi, and Eads, (H2O)PtNi are the adsorption energies of OH and H2O on Pt(111) with or without sublayer Ni atoms, respectively, and F is the Faraday constant. The DFT calculations show a positive shift of U = 0.10 V when the sublayer has 50% Ni atoms. The experiment and theory thus reach an excellent and quantitative agreement in this case and clearly establish an electronic effect of subsurface Ni on the Pt-OH chemical bonding. The ORR is a multielectron reaction ( 1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2e- = H2O) that may include a number of elementary steps involving different reaction intermediates (7, 30). We proposed that the rate of the ORR can be expressed as (2) where i is the measured current; n, F, K, E, x, , , and R are constants [(3); for definitions, see (31)]; cO2 is the concentration of O2 in the solution, ad is the total surface coverage by adsorbed spectator species [hydroxyl and anions; for example, OHad (OH) and specifically adsorbed anions (Aad)]; Gad is the Gibbs energy of adsorption of reactive intermediates, and T is temperature. In the derivation of Eq. 2, it is assumed that (i) the ORR takes place on electrodes that are modified by OHad, anions, etc., and (ii) the reactive intermediates (O -2 and H2O2) are adsorbed to low coverage (i.e., they are not a substantial part of ad). Based on these assumptions, the kinetics of O2 reduction are determined by the number of free Pt sites available for the adsorption of O2 (the 1 - ad term in Eq. 2) and by the Gad of O2 and reaction intermediates (theGad term in Eq. 2) on metal surfaces precovered by OHad. We used this reaction pathway and rate expression first to analyze the effects of electronic properties on the kinetics of the ORR on Pt3Ni(111) and Pt(111) and then, by comparing activities on different Pt3Ni(hkl) surfaces, to establish structure sensitivity. A characteristic set of polarization curves (the relation of i versus E) for the ORR on Pt-poly, Pt(111), and Pt3Ni(111) surfaces in HClO4 (0.1 M) at 333 Kis summarized in Fig. 2D. For all three surfaces, the polarization curves exhibit two distinguishable potential regions. By starting at 0.05 V and scanning the electrode potential positively, well-defined diffusion-limiting currents from 0.2 to 0.7 Vare followed by a mixed kinetic-diffusion control region between 0.8 OHad is attenuated on the Pt-skin structure, the key parameter that determines the unusually catalytic activity of Pt3Ni(111) is the low coverage by OHad [i.e., the (1 - OHad) term in the kinetic equation for the ORR]. Additional confirmation that the fractional coverages by spectator species are indeed controlling the kinetics of the ORR was found by analyzing the results in the potential region where the adsorption of hydrogen is taking place (E 0.8 V), the observed catalytic activity for the ORR on Pt3Ni(111) is the highest that has ever been observed on cathode catalysts, including the Pt3Ni(100) and Pt3Ni(110) surfaces. Synergy between surface geometry and surface electronic structure for the ORR is illustrated in Fig. 3. As summarized, the different low-index surfaces have markedly different activity for this reaction [that is, Pt3Ni(100)-skin d[111]| = 0.34 eV, where |d[hkl]| is the d-band center shift), the ORR is being enhanced by factor of 10 on Pt(111)-skin relative to that on Pt(111). Given that extended Pt surfaces have 5 to 10 times the activity per surface Pt atoms than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts that are currently used in the PEMFC (1/20.2 mA/cm2 at 0.9 V) (10, 14), a total 90-fold enhancement of Pt(111)-skin versus that of Pt/C has been achieved. Considering that the Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface exhibits the highest catalytic activity that has ever been detected, the challenge would be to create a nanocatalyst with electronic and morphological properties that mimic the Pt3Ni(111) surface. Therefore in the future, a way to reduce the current value (1/21.0 g of Pt per kW) of Pt-specific power density in a PEMFC without a loss in cell voltage, while also maintaining the maximum power density (W/cm2), would be the engineering of Pt3Ni(111)-skin-like nanocatalysts.
Abstract Primary pneumonic plague is transmitted easily, progresses rapidly, and causes high mortality, but the mechanisms by which Yersinia pestis overwhelms the lungs are largely unknown. We show that the plasminogen activator Pla is essential for Y. pestis to cause primary pneumonic plague but is less important for dissemination during pneumonic plague than during bubonic plague. Experiments manipulating its temporal expression showed that Pla allows Y. pestis to replicate rapidly in the airways, causing a lethal fulminant pneumonia; if unexpressed, inflammation is aborted, and lung repair is activated. Inhibition of Pla expression prolonged the survival of animals with the disease, offering a therapeutic option to extend the period during which antibiotics are effective. Of the three species of Yersinia pathogenic to humans, Y. pestis is infamous owing to its ability to cause plague. Although usually transmitted by an arthropod vector, it is during cases of secondary pneumonic plague that Y. pestis can be spread from person to person through the inhalation of respiratory droplets carrying the bacteria (1). This method of transmission may initiate an epidemic of primary pneumonic plague, which is fatal if not treated early. Pneumonic plague is the most likely form to result in the event of a biowarfare attack with aerosolized Y. pestis (2). Yersinia virulence in mammals requires the Ysc type III secretion system (T3SS), which is shared among all three pathogenic species (3). Unlike Y. pestis, Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis are foodborne pathogens and usually result in self-limiting gastrointestinal infections (4-6). Thus, the presence of the Ysc T3SS alone is not sufficient to cause a rapidly progressing respiratory infection. Y. pestis also carries pPCP1, a 9.5-kb plasmid that encodes the plasminogen activator Pla, a surface protease that is thought to promote plasmin degradation of fibrin clots (1, 7). In models of bubonic plague, Pla promotes the invasion of Y. pestis from subcutaneous sites of inoculation into the lymphatic system and deeper tissues but is dispensable for growth at the site of inoculation (8, 9). When introduced by aerosol, Y. pestis lacking Pla was reported to be equivalent or near equivalent in virulence to wild-type by median lethal dose (LD50) analysis (10, 11), but the progression of lung and systemic disease has never been evaluated in a model of primary pneumonic plague. On the basis of these studies, we predicted that respiratory infection with a strain of Y. pestis lacking Pla would proceed normally in the lungs and result in a lethal pneumonia but that fibrin deposition would restrict the ability of bacteria to escape the respiratory system. We infected C57BL/6 mice intranasally with wild-type Y. pestis CO92, an isogenic Y. pestis strain lacking Pla (CO92 pla), or the pla strain complemented with the coding sequence for Pla. Mice given wild-type Y. pestis CO92, a strain isolated from a fatal case of pneumonic plague (12), succumbed to the infection in a highly synchronous manner. In contrast, only 50% of the mice infected with the pla strain developed terminal plague after 7 days, and the rate at which the mice died was less synchronous than the rate of those infected with the wild-type strain (Fig. 1A). Complementation of the mutant with the coding sequence for Pla fully restored virulence. Thus, the lack of Pla substantially delayed the time to death resulting from respiratory infection.

Bacteria were introduced intranasally, and at various times CFU per organ in the lungs (B) and spleen (C) were determined. Each point represents the numbers recovered from a single mouse. The limit of detection is indicated by a dashed line. Symbols below the limit of detection represent mice that survived but did not have detectable numbers of bacteria; an "X" indicates a mouse that succumbed to the infection. A solid line indicates the median of CFU recovered. *P = 0.037, **P = 0.002, and ***P pla (white). C57BL/6 mice were infected as above, and at various times lungs were excised and weighed. *P = 0.01 and **P pla-infected mice was significantly altered (Fig. 1, B and C). After 24 hours, 100- to 1000-fold fewer bacteria were recovered from the lungs of pla-infected mice compared with the lungs with wild-type infection. Over the next 2 days, the numbers of pla bacteria in the lungs did not substantially change, whereas wild-type bacteria increased by almost 6 logs. In contrast, we detected bacteria in the spleens of all mice by 72 hours, indicating that escape of the pla strain from the lungs to distal organs still occurred (Fig. 1C). Indeed, at later times, one of five mice had a bacterial burden approaching 108 to 109 colony-forming units (CFU) in the spleen. This corresponded with increased numbers of bacteria in the lungs; however, this is likely due to the recirculation of systemic organisms back into the lungs (13) rather than outgrowth of bacteria in this organ. These data show that Pla controls the proliferation of Y. pestis in the lungs but is not essential for bacteria to disseminate. This is a distinct phenotype from that attributed to Pla in models of bubonic plague: When Pla-negative Y. pestis is introduced subcutaneously, dissemination is dramatically reduced, but bacterial outgrowth at the local site of infection is unaffected (8, 9). Indeed, we show that rates of dissemination from the initial site of colonization to the spleen were substantially increased when Pla-negative bacteria were introduced intranasally compared with the subcutaneous route (table S2). This may be due to the highly vascularized nature of the lung, allowing escape of a few Pla-negative bacteria through an alveolar capillary and thus initiating systemic infection. A hallmark of fatal bacterial pneumonia is the development of edema in the lungs, which can be measured by a change in gross lung weight as fluid and cells contribute to increased mass of the organ. Although mouse lungs infected with wild-type Y. pestis weighed significantly more than uninfected lungs, the lungs of mice infected with the pla strain of Y. pestis showed no change in weight, even after 7 days (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the death of mice infected with this strain is not due to pneumonia but rather is caused by systemic infection. Our results, therefore, may explain the similar LD50 values for wild-type and Pla-negative strains when inhaled, even though Y. pestis requires Pla to cause a severe pneumonia. We also examined lung histology of wild-type and mutant Y. pestis-infected mice to resolve an existing controversy regarding pathology and inflammation at the site of infection (8, 9, 13). An influx of inflammatory cells was detected in the lungs in both wild-type and pla infections 36 hours after inoculation; in both cases, the predominant infiltrating cell type was polymorphonuclear (Fig. 2). Although the size of the pulmonary lesions in the wild-type infection increased over time, resulting in tissue destruction and hemorrhage, the foci of inflammation in mice infected with CO92 pla remained relatively constant and restricted. In addition, we examined infected lung sections by using immunofluorescence with an antibody against Y. pestis. Numerous extracellular bacteria were associated with inflammation in the lungs of wild-type-infected mice, but relatively few bacteria were detected in the pla infection and were restricted to the much smaller inflammatory lesions (Fig. 2). Thus, both bacterial outgrowth and subsequent inflammation in the lungs were dependent on the Pla surface protease. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2. Histology and presence of bacteria in the lungs of mice during the progression of pneumonic plague. Mice were infected intranasally; at various times, lungs were inflated and fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin, and 5-1/2m sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or a Y. pestis antibody. The images shown are representative of experiments repeated twice. Scale bars indicate 200 1/2m. These results suggest that host immunity controls the pulmonary infection without developing an overwhelming inflammatory reaction to Pla-negative bacteria. Therefore, we assessed the amount of immune activation in the lungs by using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to determine changes in transcript quantities of multiple inflammatory mediators. Consistent with our previous observations (13), mice infected with CO92 remained unresponsive early in the infection but showed significant cytokine up-regulation by 48 hours (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the cytokine transcript numbers in the lungs of mice infected with pla were also relatively unchanged early in the infection. After 48 hours, however, cytokine transcript numbers in response to pla were unchanged or only slightly increased, and by the following day of infection transcript numbers for most cytokines decreased, suggesting down-regulation of the inflammatory response to pla. Thus, the data reveal that, in the absence of Pla, an anti-inflammatory state is maintained in the lungs and the infection is unable to progress to the pro-inflammatory phase that we described previously (13).

PCNA-positive cells (arrows) are present in the lungs of pla-infected mice but largely absent in the wild-type infection. Extranuclear granular staining in the CO92-infected lungs correlate with the presence of bacteria. Scale bars, 50 1/2m. That cytokine transcript amounts appeared to stabilize and then decrease in the pla-infected mice suggested the pulmonary inflammatory lesions were resolving. We immunostained infected lungs for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a marker for host cellular DNA synthesis (14). Whereas the cells of wild-type-infected lungs were almost uniformly PCNA-negative (Fig. 3B), large numbers of PCNA-positive cells were present in pla-infected mice (Fig. 3C), indicating active cell proliferation and regeneration of tissue in the lungs. Lung repair at this stage of the infection is further evidence that fatalities among pla-infected mice are not a consequence of airway inflammation or damage but instead are the result of systemic spread of the bacteria. If Pla alone controls the ability of Y. pestis to cause pneumonic plague, we hypothesized that experimental induction of pla expression midway during the aborted pulmonary disease would be sufficient to turn the nonpneumonic infection into a pneumonic one. To test this, we adapted the tetracycline-responsive promoter system (15) to exogenously control gene expression in Y. pestis during infection (Materials and Methods and figs. S1 and S2). We cultured the pla strain of Y. pestis carrying pla under control of the tetracycline-responsive promoter (Y. pestis CO92 pla Ptet-pla, strain YP138) in pla-repressing conditions (i.e., absence of anhydrotetracycline, or ATC). Thirty-six hours after intranasal inoculation, we induced pla expression by injecting ATC and then followed the progression of the infection. Bacteria in the pla-repressed state established a nonprogressive lung infection in a manner similar to that of the pla-infected mice. However, once ATC was administered and Pla expression was up-regulated, the condition of these mice quickly converted to a disease with all the features of pneumonic plague: rapid proliferation of bacteria with development of visible microcolonies (Fig. 4, A and B), unrestricted inflammatory infiltrate, tissue damage (Fig. 4C), and shortened time to death. Thus, the absence of Pla stalls the development of disease in the early anti-inflammatory phase but does not eliminate the potential of these organisms to cause pneumonic plague. Ultimately, the block in the progression of infection by the respiratory route is completely reversible by the expression of Pla. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 4.

CFU in the lungs (A) and spleen (B) were determined at various times. Symbols and lines as in Fig. 1. (C) Lung histology of mice infected with the Ptet-pla strain and treated with PBS or ATC.

Survival of mice infected with CO92 pla plus Ptet-pla in the pla-induced state for the duration of the experiment (black) [mean time to death (MTD) = 3.1 days], in the pla-repressed state for the duration (blue) (MTD = 5.1 days), or in the pla-induced state for the first day followed by the pla-repressed state for the remainder of the experiment (red) (MTD = 4.6 days). See Materials and Methods for details. The bar beneath the graph approximates the period at which pla induction ends and repression begins. One hypothesis of the mechanism by which Pla facilitates the invasive nature of Y. pestis is that the protease converts host plasminogen into plasmin while degrading the plasmin inhibitor 2-antiplasmin, releasing bacteria from the entrapment of fibrin clots (16, 17). Indeed, recent evidence has shown that fibrin deposition is an important means of immune control for a variety of pathogens (18-20), and thus the subversion of the coagulation cascade may be a notable virulence mechanism. Consistent with this, we show that the plasminogen-activating activity of Pla is essential to Y. pestis virulence in the pulmonary system (Materials and Methods and fig. S3). Additionally, fibrin(ogen) deposition can be detected in the lungs of mice infected with either the wild-type or the pla strain, but the pattern and extent of fibrin(ogen) immunostaining is substantially altered (fig. S4). We cannot exclude, however, the possibility that other targets of Pla activity may also contribute to the development of primary pneumonic plague. Nonetheless, the role of Pla during pneumonic plague may help explain how Y. pestis acquired the ability to cause a rapid, severe respiratory infection and be transmitted from person to person by the aerosol route, whereas Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica did not. Interestingly, the altered syndrome we observed with a Pla-negative strain is similar to case descriptions from the early 20th-century Manchurian epidemics in which aerosol-acquired plague resulted in fatal sepsis before a local lung disease could develop (21). The critical role for Pla suggests that its inhibition could offer a therapeutic advantage, particularly because the rapid progression of pneumonic plague leaves little time for effective treatment. We tested this experimentally by infecting mice with the Pla-inducible Y. pestis strain YP138 prepared in the presence of ATC. We then provided ATC to the animals for only the first day of the infection, allowing the ATC to be cleared and pla expression to be repressed for the remainder of the experiment. The time until death was delayed when the Pla-induced state was switched to a Pla-repressed state during the infection (Fig. 4D); in fact, the kinetics more closely resemble those of a pla infection. This suggests that exogenous inhibition of Pla during primary pneumonic plague may indeed prolong the survival of the affected individual, expanding the window during which antibiotics could be successfully administered to treat the disease.
Abstract Genetic surveys reveal the diversity of bacteria and lead to the questioning of species concepts used to categorize bacteria. One difficulty in defining bacterial species arises from the high rates of recombination that results in the transfer of DNA between relatively distantly related bacteria. Barriers to this process, which could be used to define species naturally, are not apparent. Here, we review conceptual models of bacterial speciation and describe our computer simulations of speciation. Our findings suggest that the rate of recombination and its relation to genetic divergence have a strong influence on outcomes. We propose that a distinction be made between clonal divergence and sexual speciation. Hence, to make sense of bacterial diversity, we need data not only from genetic surveys but also from experimental determination of selection pressures and recombination rates and from theoretical models. Bacteria are promiscuous. They often live in environments with an abundant diversity of donor DNA, and studies of the genomes of members of the same, or similar, species indicate the dynamic nature of gene acquisition, loss, and transfer (1). It is probably possible, through a series of intermediates and vectors, to transfer genes between any two bacteria. Besides the illegitimate recombinational process that leads to gene acquisition from distantly related sources, there is convincing evidence that homologous recombination may frequently replace small regions of the genome of a bacterium with those from other members of the same species or from closely related species (2). The rate of homologous recombination varies greatly. In some species it appears to be rare and leads to the evolution of distinct clonal lineages, whereas in others these localized recombinational imports arise much more frequently than mutations (3). In recent years, extensive homologous recombination has been shown to be so widespread that it may be regarded as the norm rather than the exception. Nonetheless, surveys of genetic diversity in the bacterial kingdom are revealing that, far from a continuum mediated by promiscuous gene exchange, bacteria seem to form clusters of genetically related strains (species), at least for those genera studied so far (4-6). There is thus uncertainty regarding the nature of bacterial speciation and the influence that homologous recombination exerts upon it (7). One proposition is that speciation (by which we mean the generation of permanently distinct clusters of closely related bacteria) could arise, not because of fundamental ecological constraints or geographic separation but rather as a consequence of recombination failing more frequently between DNA sequences that are different than between those that are similar (8-10). In experimental studies of recombination in bacteria from widely differing genera, a consistent pattern of decline in the recombination rate as a function of genetic distance has been observed (Fig. 1A) (11). This effect has been shown to be associated with the various mechanisms that detect the sequence similarities between donor and recipient DNA, principally MutS-mediated mismatch repair and RecA-mediated recombination (12-14). RecA is involved in initiating recombination between donor and recipient DNA and is thus essential for recombination, whereas MutS inhibits recombination between mismatched sequences. One mechanism that has received particular attention is the requirement of RecA for minimally efficient processing segments (MEPS), which are short regions of sequence identity located at either end of the donor DNA strand and hypothesized to be required for recombination to occur (15). This mechanism can generate the general relationship seen in Fig. 1A and provides a corroborative estimate for the length of MEPS of between 20 and 30 base pairs (bp) (16). Whatever mechanism underlies the decline in recombination with increasing sequence divergence, this relationship results in constraints on recombination that operates at the genomic level, potentially allowing species distinctness to emerge as a dynamic corollary to diversification and adaptation (8, 9).

(C) Schematic representation of the simulated genomes in a stochastic neutral model. MLST genes are highlighted. Although this picture of speciation driven by recombinational (i.e., sexual) incompatibility is appealing, especially for the parallels it offers with the biological species concept of Mayr (17), the elucidation of the quantitative detail of recombinational incompatibility is only one aspect of the story (or stories) of bacterial speciation. What drives new strains to cross these "soft" genetic barriers and form new species? How distinct must clusters be for this soft barrier to be effective enough to maintain separation and for the evolutionary fate of each cluster to be distinct? Is there a consistent mechanism of speciation that applies to all bacteria, irrespective of the rates and mechanisms of recombination, which are known empirically to be extremely variable? Modeling Bacterial Diversity Genetic surveys of bacterial populations usually provide a static picture of the patterns of genotypic clustering; consequently, exploring the dynamics of populations requires theoretical models studied using computer simulations and analytical approximations. Clustering in natural populations can then be compared with those from simulated populations if the genotypes of strains are defined in the same way. Isolates within bacterial populations are commonly characterized by the alleles at seven housekeeping loci [multilocus sequence typing (MLST)], where each allele corresponds to a different sequence (18). We have developed a model in which strains are defined in the same way and in which alleles change at defined rates by mutation or recombination. We also showed that genetic diversity in several bacterial pathogens could be explained by this simple model of neutral drift (19). The use of neutral models of mutation and drift is not a denial of selection but a recognition that much observed population genetic structure can be explained in simple terms. It makes sense, as a null model, to explore the dynamics of neutral diversification and the conditions under which populations do, or do not, separate into distinct genotypic clusters that mimic the emergence of species. Estimates for the rates of mutation and recombination are available from empirical studies of a variety of bacteria [e.g., (2, 20)], as is the relationship between sequence divergence and recombination rate shown in Fig. 1A. We estimated population mutation rates (denoted ) in the range 1 to 10, whereas recombination rates (denoted ) are more variable, ranging from 0.1 to 100 (19, 20). These values are expressed per gene segment per generation and are related to the underlying biological mutation and recombination rates (denoted m and r, respectively) by a constant known as the effective population size Ne, such that = 2mLNe and = 2rNe. Our estimates of are based on genes approximately L 500 bp long, and if we take a plausible estimate of the DNA mutation rate (m) at 5 * 10-10 per base pair per replication (21), we get a ballpark estimate for the effective population size Ne of 107. The effective population size is not directly related to the census population size but is rather a measure of how much neutral diversity the environment can carry. It may be considerably smaller than the census population size as a result of factors such as regular bottlenecks, genome-wide selective sweeps, or hierarchical structure (22). Consider, for example, an infectious agent such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. At least three factors result in an effective population size many orders of magnitude smaller than the actual number of bacteria. First, the bacterial population is divided into distinct populations within individual humans and is transmitted by small inocula, so that the number of infected people may be a better measure of population size than the number of bacteria. Second, transmission is seasonal, with peaks occurring during the winter months, creating bottlenecks during the low season, so that the effective population size may reflect the number of people infected during these bottlenecks. Third, the human contact network is hierarchically structured into communities, communities of communities, and so on, so that the effective number of people infected is lower than the actual number of people infected (23). Thus, a population of trillions of bacteria can have a low effective population size. Similar considerations may influence effective population sizes in many environments, such as the partitioning of marine bacteria around nutrient-rich coastal regions, seasonal regulation caused by the "bloom-bust" cycle of algal nutrient availability, and local clustering of populations around small particles of nutrients (24). In general, most natural populations of bacteria live in structured environments with well-defined patches of growth, where serious limits exist on the dispersion of novel types between patches. Establishing plausible estimates for Ne for a diverse range of bacteria, as well as identifying the factors that affect it, should be a research priority. To explore speciation, we extended our previous model (19) to simulate simplified genomes (Fig. 1C), with an effective population size Ne = 105 andapopulationmutationrate = 2, and defined each strain by the alleles at a larger number of loci (70) to counter the effect that occasional recombination at a single locus has in distorting relationships between otherwise divergent or similar strains (25). This model ignores several heterogeneities that may arise in populations (e.g., fitness, ecology, and recombination rate) but may nonetheless provide a preliminary description of the generation of diversity by drift. Our choice of parameters and model structure is an inevitable compromise between plausibility and computational limitations, achieved principally by reducing the effective population size and by using an approximation algorithm for modeling mutation of DNA sequences (25). The Clonal-Sexual Threshold The most salient feature of this simple model is a sharp transition in population structure with increasing rates of homologous recombination. When recombination rates are low, the population is effectively clonal in structure. In some sense, each clone has a separate evolutionary fate, because novel alleles that arise are unlikely to spread horizontally through the population. A feature of neutral population structure in the clonal region is strong genotypic clustering (Fig. 2, A and B). These clusters are unstable, and the long-term dynamics are characterized by a constant process in which major clusters regularly emerge by chance, split, drift apart, and eventually become extinct (Fig. 2C).

All populations are evolving under neutral drift and are homogeneously mixing. (A, D, and G) Genetic maps, which are determined by principal coordinate analysis (36), represent the genetic distances between 1000 randomly chosen isolates from the simulated population after 106 generations have elapsed. Coordinates are expressed in units of sequence divergence. (B, E, and H) An alternative way to represent clustering is the distribution of sequence divergence between pairs of isolates in the population. The thin lines show the distance between five random strains and all the other strains in the sample, whereas the thick red line shows the distribution of all the pairwise distances. Where there is little clustering (E), all pairwise distances are similar and the distribution has a single peak; where there is strong clustering [(B) and (H)], the distribution has multiple peaks corresponding to pairwise comparisons within and between clusters. (C, F, and I) Distribution of the pairwise comparisons evolving over 106 generations. To normalize the distribution, pairs of isolates are compared for the number of alleles that are different, between 0 and 70, rather than for the proportion of base pairs as in (B), (E), and (H). The height of the distribution is represented by color shade, ranging from black (0.0) to red (>0.1), so that peaks in (B), (E), and (H) correspond to red shaded areas in (C), (F), and (I). (C) and (I) show clusters moving apart, visible as red peaks moving up through time. When clusters split, a new peak appears at the bottom; extinctions are apparent from peaks disappearing. (F) shows instead more stable population structure, with a stable diffuse cluster being maintained throughout the simulation. Parameter values for and , the population mutation and recombination rates, are = 2, = 0.01 [(A) to (C)], = 20 * 10-18x, where x is the sequence divergence [(D) to (F)]. We also explored under which conditions clustering could occur in the presence of high recombination rates [(G) to (I)]. Clusters with high within-cluster recombination can be generated, mimicking spontaneous speciation [(G) to (I)], but require that recombination rate declines as a function of sequence divergence at a very rapid rate uncharacteristic of most bacteria studied to date, such that = 20 * 10-300x. When recombination rates are increased to values between one-fourth and twice the mutation rate (per locus), a threshold is passed where clusters no longer diverge but are constantly reabsorbed into the parent population by the cohesive force of recombination. Alleles can succeed through horizontal spread even when the parental lineage does not. The degree of clustering is much reduced compared with the clonal situation (Fig. 2, D and E), and dynamic analysis (Fig. 2F) reveals that the clustering that does occur is transient. It is worth noting that in both situations, the degree of diversity at each locus is the same and is governed by the balance between extinction and mutation. The sexual population contains more distinct genotypes, based on different combinations of a similar number of alleles. Recombination is frequent enough that the fate of alleles at one locus is not tied to their association with alleles at other loci. In the clonal situation, in contrast, clusters regularly become extinct (Fig. 2C), and extinction of clones is the principal regulator of diversity as a whole. Clustering can be defined as over-dispersion of the genetic distances between isolates (Fig. 2, B, E, and H), and a measure of this is the index of association (26). In earlier work, we showed how to calculate this index for neutral models (without the dependence on sequence divergence of Fig. 1) (19), and we have shown that the threshold between clonal and sexual regimes holds for a wide range of parameters (20). The transition between clonal and sexual population structure is studied in more detail in the accompanying
Abstract Marine biogenic dimethylsulfide (DMS) is the main natural source of tropospheric sulfur, which may play a key role in cloud formation and albedo over the remote ocean. Through a global data analysis, we found that DMS concentrations are highly positively correlated with the solar radiation dose in the upper mixed layer of the open ocean, irrespective of latitude, plankton biomass, or temperature. This is a necessary condition for the feasibility of a negative feedback in which light-attenuating DMS emissions are in turn driven by the light dose received by the pelagic ecosystem. Oceanic biota influence climate in the long term by shaping the biogeochemical cycles of elements essential for Earth-system functioning (suchasC, O, N, P, Si, and S) (1-3) and in the short term by exchanging climate-active gases with the atmosphere (greenhouse gases, oxidant and light scavengers, and free-radical and aerosol precursors) (4-8). One of these gases is dimethylsulfide (DMS), which represents the largest natural source of atmospheric sulfur and a major precursor of hygroscopic (i.e., cloudforming) particles in clean air over the remote oceans (4, 9), thereby acting to reduce the amount of solar radiation that crosses the atmosphere and is absorbed by the ocean. A 20-year-old hypothesis (10) postulated that marine plankton, cloud albedo, and solar radiation can be connected through DMS production, ventilation, and oxidation in a feedback interaction; whether this feedback would be positive or negative was uncertain. We wanted to explore whether DMS concentrations are linked to epipelagic ecosystem exposure to solar radiation. A monthly sampling of surface DMS concentrations, as well as biological and physical variables, was conducted during 2003 and part of 2004 at the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory, located at 4130'N, 248'Ein the coastal northwest Mediterranean. We noted that the light exposure of an idealized seawater particle (and its associated dissolved substances and buoyant organisms) depends not only on the surface irradiance and its underwater attenuation but also on the depth of the mixed layer within which the particle is confined. Thus, we estimated the daily-averaged solar radiation received in the uppermixedlayer(UML), or UML solar radiation dose (SRD), from measured data of the daily-averaged surface irradiance, the underwater light extinction coefficient, and the mixed layer depth (MLD) (11). A linear regression analysis revealed that, during the period examined, the SRD accounted for 94% of the variance of monthly surface DMS concentrations (Fig. 1).

A Spearman correlation analysis of thesamedatagives asignificant positive coefficient = 0.75 (P 10'N, 6430'W) produced similar results. Daily surface irradiances measured in Bermuda as well as MLD and extinction coefficients measured at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study station nearby (11) were used to estimate the UML solar radiation dose on the same days as DMS was measured. The variation in the SRD explained 81% of the variance of monthly surface DMS concentrations (Fig. 2). This is consistent with a recent work (13) showing that the net biological production and concentration of DMS in the UML was highly correlated with the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) dose at this same study site.

Dots are monthly data during the period from January 1992 to November 1994. Error bars represent standard deviations of multiple sampling days each month. A Spearman correlation analysis of the same data gives a significant positive coefficient = 0.89 (P = -0.51) and the Sargasso Sea ( = -0.61) (13) sampling sites. This is not a particular case of these two stations. Away from the equatorial region, surface DMS concentrations usually peak in summer. In subtropical and low temperate regions, this maximum DMS coincides with a minimum of phytoplankton biomass. This feature has been called the "DMS summer paradox" (14). At high latitudes and over most of the Southern Ocean, on the other hand, the summer surface DMS maximum co-occurs with a chl-a maximum, and both variables look strongly correlated (15). Such a heterogeneous behavior results in very weak global correlations between DMS and chl-a (15, 16). To assess whether global DMS distributions better follow those of solar radiation or sea surface temperature (SST) than those of plankton biomass, we compiled monthly global maps of available DMS concentrations from the Global Surface Seawater (GSS) DMS database (17). This database includes about 30,000 individual data points collected from 1972 to 2003. No information about the corresponding in situ MLD, surface irradiances, or light extinction coefficients is available directly from the database. Boyer-Montegut et al. (18) recently constructed a comprehensive climatology of global MLD based on more than 4,000,000 temperature profiles obtained between 1941 and 2002. We made use of this climatology with a modification of the definition criterion (11). The daily averaged solar irradiance at the top-of-the-atmosphere was calculated (19) and converted into ocean-surface irradiance (I0) considering a transmission coefficient of 0.5-that is, an atmospheric reduction by a half (20). Monthly global maps of SRD were obtained from the aforementioned variables in the same way as for the local studies (11). For chl-a concentrations and SST, we used satellite-derived climatologies (11). Monthly latitudinal distributions of DMS, chl-a, SST, and SRD show that DMS follows solar radiation dose much more closely than it follows plankton biomass or temperature (Fig. 3).

Month (April through March) by latitude plots of climatological global distributions of satellite-derived chl-a concentrations (CHLsat, Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor, 2002 to 2004), satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SSTsat, Climate Diagnostics Center, 1971 to 2000), surface DMS concentrations (GSS DMS database), and the SRD (calculated). All variables are monthly averaged by 10 latitude bands. Spearman coefficients () for the correlations between the latitude-month distributions of DMS and the other variables are DMS versus CHLsat, 0.08; DMS versus SSTsat, 0.16; DMS versus SRD, 0.56 (n = 155). We divided the surface of the globe into 324 boxes of 10 latitude by 20 longitude. Available DMS measurements and calculated SRD values were averaged for each month and each box. Next, we subdivided the range of SRD values (from 0 to 210 W m-2) into spaced intervals of 15 W m-2, and mean standard deviation was calculated for the box-averaged DMS concentrations corresponding to each of the intervals. Data from different latitudes and months were averaged together as long as they had a similar solar radiation dose. The highest 5% of the DMS box means were purposely not taken into account in order to exclude high DMS values associated with eutrophic coastal systems and local blooms of algae that produce very high amounts of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which are well-documented short-term sources of DMS that would have a disproportionately high weight on the averages. This cut-off criterion roughly corresponded to an upper limit of 10 nM (fig. S1). The final number of box-month combinations used was 545, and the total number of GSS DMS data points included was about 26,400-i.e., nearly 90% of the original data. Consistent with the local time series, a significant positive correlation was found between averaged surface DMS concentrations and the SRD along the radiation dose range (Fig. 4). Notably, there is a strong similarity between the slope and the intercept of the globally derived linear equation and those obtained in the Sargasso Sea (Fig. 2). Even though the data scatter for the global relationship is quite large (shaded areas in Fig. 4), the upper and lower contours of the scatter still show clear proportionality between DMS and the SRD.

The numbers by the data points indicate the amount of DMS box means used for each average (upper number) and the amount of original data included (number in parentheses). A Spearman correlation analysis of the 545 boxmeans givesa significant positive coefficient = 0.47 (P << 0.01). Although upper-ocean DMS dynamics have been the object of extensive research, definitive conclusions about the main factors controlling DMS concentrations have remained elusive, and this has prevented giving an unequivocal sign for any feedback link between climate and DMS. Experimental work (9, 12) has unveiled the interaction of multiple biotic and abiotic players (e.g., phytoplankton composition and physiological state, zooplankton grazing, bacterial activity and diversity, and photolysis), and solar radiation (and especially UVR) exerts a substantial but not straightforward influence on many of them (21-23). A particularly relevant, recent hypothesis suggests that DMS leakage from the algal cell is the by-product of a sulfur-based antioxidant mechanism (21). Given that high light (high UVR) doses induce oxidative stress (i.e, DMS release) and inhibit bacterial DMS consumption as well (23), DMS may accumulate in seawater. Phytoplankton succession to higher-DMSP producers in summer stratified waters, oxidative stress on these producers, and oxidative damage on DMS consumers may be concurrent reasons why DMS concentrations are higher in high-light conditions. A recent analysis of the DMS time series in the Sargasso Sea revealed that the temporal DMS variation emerging from such a complex cycle resembles that of the local UVR, and the latter was suggested as the major driving force (13). Whether this very same quantitative DMS-UVR relationship would be applicable to most of the global ocean was unknown but unlikely, because other local factors such as plankton abundance and community structure would be expected to have a large complementary influence. Nonetheless, a pioneering work by Bates et al. (24) showed, with the few data available at the time, that the seasonally averaged DMS emission flux covaried with the seasonally averaged surface solar irradiance at different latitudes. More recently, the depth of the UML was seen to have a regulatory influence on DMS production and concentration on a global scale, and it was hypothesized that such regulation would partly occur through the effects of the MLD on plankton exposure to solar radiation (14, 25). Using the most comprehensive data set available today, we show that surface DMS concentrations respond positively to the UML solar radiation dose, and this response follows the same proportionality over the global open ocean, irrespective of latitude and the large variability of, for example, temperature and trophic status. One of the challenges of today's Earthsystem science is to elucidate how the biosphere responds to climate in ways that in turn influence climate (26), determine their operation time scale, and clarify whether these responses confer stability to the climate system in front of perturbations such as anthropogenic global environmental change. The tight coupling of DMS concentrations to the solar radiation dose that we observed is a necessary condition for the occurrence of a negative feedback between plankton and climate through the influence of the former on the radiative energy budget (10). Notably, it also provides a clue on the time scale of such feedback. The solar radiation dose of the surface ocean varies strongly over the seasonal cycle as a consequence of the coupled variation of surface irradiance and the MLD. Our data indicate that it is at this seasonal scale that the epipelagic ecosystems respond to temporal and latitudinal changes in solar radiation by changing their production of light-attenuating volatile sulfur. Exploration of responses at time scales shorter than a month should be carried out with high-resolution measurements of DMS and solar radiation in coherent water masses. Whether this feedback will also operate efficiently at the longer time scale of anthropogenic global warming will depend on induced changes in global cloudiness, aerosol light scattering, and, most important, mixing depths in the ocean.
Abstract The slow rate of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is the main limitation for automotive applications. We demonstrated that the Pt3Ni(111) surface is 10-fold more active for the ORR than the corresponding Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than the current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts for PEMFC. The Pt3Ni(111) surface has an unusual electronic structure (d-band center position) and arrangement of surface atoms in the near-surface region. Under operating conditions relevant to fuel cells, its near-surface layer exhibits a highly structured compositional oscillation in the outermost and third layers, which are Pt-rich, and in the second atomic layer, which is Ni-rich. The weak interaction between the Pt surface atoms and nonreactive oxygenated species increases the number of active sites for O2 adsorption. When a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is used in a demanding application such as an automobile, it must overcome the kinetic limitations on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which have led to three fundamental problems (1-5). First, the substantial overpotential for the ORR (6-10) at practical operating current densities reduces the thermal efficiency well below the thermodynamic limits, typically to about 43% at 0.7 V [versus the theoretical thermal efficiency of 83% at the reversible potential for the ORR (1.23 V)]. Second, an approximately five-fold reduction of the amount of Pt (platinum-loading) in current PEMFC stacks is needed to meet the cost requirements for large-scale automotive applications (10). Finally, the dissolution and/or loss of Pt surface area in the cathode must be greatly reduced. These limitations could be eliminated if stable cathode catalysts, with an order of magnitude increase in the specific activity over that of state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts, can be developed (10). In the hope that a combination of different metals would have improved catalytic activity and stability relative to those of a pure metal, the ORR has been studied on numerous bi- or multimetallic alloys (6, 8, 11-17). These studies have led to incremental improvements to catalyst performance, but large increases in activity have yet to be realized. Rather than use a trial-and-error or combinatorial approach, we have examined selected cathode materials with well-characterized surfaces so that the mechanism of action can be attributed to a specific property (at the atomic and molecular level) of the surface under study. In this way, we can determine (i) whether the kinetics of the ORR are structure-sensitive, (ii) the composition of the topmost surface atomic layers (the segregation profile), and (iii) how alloying [usually described in terms of the ligand effect or/and ensemble effect (18-20)] alters the chemical properties of the surfaces. Similar approaches are commonly used in gas-phase catalysis (21) under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and near-ambient conditions, but alloy surface chemistry on single-crystal surfaces at electrochemical interfaces is relatively unexplored. These aqueous interfaces are more complex in that they necessarily contain solvent and electronic/ionic charge, and (experimentally) it is very challenging but still tractable to use in situ surface-sensitive methods to characterize potential-induced changes in the surface properties and reactivity. We have used a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the ORR on Pt3Ni(hkl) single-crystal surfaces, identify which surface properties govern the variations in reactivity of PtNi catalysts, and determine how surface structures, surface segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect the ORR kinetics. Well-characterized PtNi single-crystal electrode surfaces were formed and characterized with UHV methods for surface preparation and surface analysis. These surfaces were transferred into the electrochemical environment without airborne contamination, and the stability of the UHV-prepared surface was determined with a combination of in situ surface-sensitive probes with electrochemical methods so that activity relationships could be obtained in real time. The results of the preparation and characterization of Pt3Ni(hkl) alloy surfaces in UHV are summarized in Fig. 1. The surface-sensitive techniques that were used included low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and synchrotron-based high-resolution ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) (see methods in the supporting online material). Each of these methods has certain advantages, and they yield complementary information. The surface symmetry obtained from LEED analysis shows that, whereas the Pt3Ni(111) surface exhibits a (1 * 1) pattern (Fig. 1D) (i.e., that of the bulk termination), the atomically less dense Pt3Ni(100) surface shows a (1 * 5) reconstruction pattern (the so-called "hex" phase) in both the [011] and [01-1] directions (Fig. 1E). Analysis of the Pt3Ni(110) LEED data (Fig. 1F) indicates that this surface may exhibit a mixture of (1 * 1) and (1 * 2) periodicities, the latter being known as the (1 * 2) missing-row structure (22).

The composition of the outermost atomic layer was obtained with LEIS, as previously shown for Pt3Ni polycrystalline alloys (15, 23); after a final anneal, the surface atomic layer of all three Pt3Ni(hkl) crystals is pure Pt (Fig. 1B) [i.e., all form the so-called Pt-skin structures (17, 20)]. Previous studies of PtNi single-crystal surfaces in UHV had indicated that this surface enrichment of Pt in the first layer is counterbalanced by its depletion in the next two to three atomic layers, so that the concentration profile oscillates around the bulk value (24, 25). We demonstrated that segregation-driven near-surface compositional changes result in distinctive electronic properties of the PtNi (hkl) alloys. The surface electronic structures were obtained from the background-corrected UPS spectra (26). As summarized in Fig. 1C, the d-band density of states (DOS) is structure-sensitive, and the position of the d-band center shifts from -2.70 eVon Pt3Ni(110) to -3.10 eVon Pt3Ni(111) to -3.14 eV on Pt3Ni(100). Furthermore, the DOS of the alloy surfaces is quite different from that of corresponding pure Pt single crystals; that is, on the (110), (100), and (111) alloy surfaces, the d-band center is downshifted by about 0.16, 0.24, and 0.34 eV, respectively. An important yet largely unexplored issue in surface electrochemistry on alloys is understanding how chemisorption energies correlate with the average energy of the d-state on the surface atoms to which the adsorbate binds (i.e., the ligand effect). To do this, we compared the results on the (111) surfaces with the same composition and arrangement of surface atoms but with a different d-band center position. Although we are highlighting how the difference between the electronic surface structures of Pt(111) and Pt3Ni(111) can affect the adsorption of spectator species and the kinetics of the ORR, the findings are generally applicable to other single-crystal alloy surfaces. We next determined the stability of a surface after transfer from UHV into the electrochemical environment. Surface x-ray scattering (SXS) was used to characterize both the potential range of stability as well as the near-surface composition of the alloy in situ. Only results for Pt3Ni(111) are presented because they provide the most useful information about the potential-induced changes in the surface structure and segregation profile; a brief description of results for (110) and (100) can be found in (27). The termination of the Pt3Ni(111) lattice at the surface in terms of elemental composition and surface relaxation was determined by measurement and analysis of the crystal truncation rods (CTRs) (28). Pt3Ni(111) has the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice with random occupation of sites by Pt and Ni, and this lattice gives rise to SXS similar to that obtained from a monocrystalline fcc lattice. Sensitivity to atomic layer composition is enhanced by the use of anomalous x-ray scattering techniques in which the incident x-ray energy is tuned to an atomic adsorption edge of the material (29). Thus, from SXS, we obtained information about the positions and compositions, both in the surface and subsurface layers. The CTR analysis shows that, at 0.05 V, the first layer is composed entirely of Pt and, whereas the second atomic layer is Ni-rich (52% of Ni as compared to 25% of Ni in the bulk), the third layer is again Pt-enriched (87%) (Fig. 2A). Having determined the near-surface structure at 0.05 V, the potential was cycled while the scattered x-ray intensity was measured at a CTR position that is sensitive to surface relaxation and surface roughness (Fig. 2A). We find that both the Pt3Ni(111) surface structure as well as the segregation profile are completely stable over this potential range because the changes in the x-ray scattering signal are fully reversible, and we find that the decrease in intensity at positive potential is consistent with an inward relaxation (contraction) of the surface atomic layer (this result is confirmed by similar measurements at other reciprocal lattice positions). The contraction of Pt surface atoms is induced by the adsorption of oxygenated species, which is determined by the Ni-induced modification of the Pt-skin electronic structure. A direct consequence of contraction of the topmost layer of Pt-skin at the potentials higher than 0.8 V is the increased stability of this surface over corresponding pure Pt(111), which was additionally confirmed by prolonged cycling in the designated potential range.

I, II, and III represent potential region of Hapd adsorption/desorption processes, double-layer region, and region of OHad layer formation, respectively. The relations between the surface electronic properties and the potential-dependent surface coverage by adsorbing species (the adsorption isotherms in Fig. 2C) were established by comparing the experimentally determined position of the d-band centers to the fractional coverages of adsorbed hydrogen (H+ +e- = Hupd, where Hupd refers to the underpotentially deposited hydrogen) between 0.05 0.15 V) in Hupd formation and positive shift (0.1 V) in OHad formation occurred relative to Pt(111). In agreement with the onset of adsorption, on Pt3Ni(111), the fractional coverages by Hupd and OHad (Hupd and OHad) were dramatically reduced by 50% relative to Pt(111), which is in agreement with the large downshift (0.34 eV) of the d-band center position on the Pt-skin structure. As shown in Fig. 1, H and I, similar changes occurred for the other two single-crystal surfaces. On the Pt(100)-skin, Hupd was reduced by 15% relative to Pt(100), and OHad was reduced by 25%. On Pt3Ni(110), small but clearly discernable decreases in Hupd (10%) and the fractional coverage by OHad (OH) (20%) were observed relative to Pt(110). To describe these effects quantitatively, we performed DFT calculations, using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set, on the adsorption of OH and H2O at 0.25 monolayer coverage on modeled Pt(111) surfaces, with second atomic layers containing 0 or 50% Ni atoms. In acid solutions, OHad would react with H+ and form H2O on the catalyst surface. The change in the reversible potential U of the above reaction on Pt(111) resulting from sublayer Ni atoms is (1) Here, Eads(OH)Pt, Eads(H2O)Pt, Eads(OH)PtNi, and Eads, (H2O)PtNi are the adsorption energies of OH and H2O on Pt(111) with or without sublayer Ni atoms, respectively, and F is the Faraday constant. The DFT calculations show a positive shift of U = 0.10 V when the sublayer has 50% Ni atoms. The experiment and theory thus reach an excellent and quantitative agreement in this case and clearly establish an electronic effect of subsurface Ni on the Pt-OH chemical bonding. The ORR is a multielectron reaction ( 1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2e- = H2O) that may include a number of elementary steps involving different reaction intermediates (7, 30). We proposed that the rate of the ORR can be expressed as (2) where i is the measured current; n, F, K, E, x, , , and R are constants [(3); for definitions, see (31)]; cO2 is the concentration of O2 in the solution, ad is the total surface coverage by adsorbed spectator species [hydroxyl and anions; for example, OHad (OH) and specifically adsorbed anions (Aad)]; Gad is the Gibbs energy of adsorption of reactive intermediates, and T is temperature. In the derivation of Eq. 2, it is assumed that (i) the ORR takes place on electrodes that are modified by OHad, anions, etc., and (ii) the reactive intermediates (O -2 and H2O2) are adsorbed to low coverage (i.e., they are not a substantial part of ad). Based on these assumptions, the kinetics of O2 reduction are determined by the number of free Pt sites available for the adsorption of O2 (the 1 - ad term in Eq. 2) and by the Gad of O2 and reaction intermediates (theGad term in Eq. 2) on metal surfaces precovered by OHad. We used this reaction pathway and rate expression first to analyze the effects of electronic properties on the kinetics of the ORR on Pt3Ni(111) and Pt(111) and then, by comparing activities on different Pt3Ni(hkl) surfaces, to establish structure sensitivity. A characteristic set of polarization curves (the relation of i versus E) for the ORR on Pt-poly, Pt(111), and Pt3Ni(111) surfaces in HClO4 (0.1 M) at 333 Kis summarized in Fig. 2D. For all three surfaces, the polarization curves exhibit two distinguishable potential regions. By starting at 0.05 V and scanning the electrode potential positively, well-defined diffusion-limiting currents from 0.2 to 0.7 Vare followed by a mixed kinetic-diffusion control region between 0.8 OHad is attenuated on the Pt-skin structure, the key parameter that determines the unusually catalytic activity of Pt3Ni(111) is the low coverage by OHad [i.e., the (1 - OHad) term in the kinetic equation for the ORR]. Additional confirmation that the fractional coverages by spectator species are indeed controlling the kinetics of the ORR was found by analyzing the results in the potential region where the adsorption of hydrogen is taking place (E 0.8 V), the observed catalytic activity for the ORR on Pt3Ni(111) is the highest that has ever been observed on cathode catalysts, including the Pt3Ni(100) and Pt3Ni(110) surfaces. Synergy between surface geometry and surface electronic structure for the ORR is illustrated in Fig. 3. As summarized, the different low-index surfaces have markedly different activity for this reaction [that is, Pt3Ni(100)-skin d[111]| = 0.34 eV, where |d[hkl]| is the d-band center shift), the ORR is being enhanced by factor of 10 on Pt(111)-skin relative to that on Pt(111). Given that extended Pt surfaces have 5 to 10 times the activity per surface Pt atoms than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts that are currently used in the PEMFC (1/20.2 mA/cm2 at 0.9 V) (10, 14), a total 90-fold enhancement of Pt(111)-skin versus that of Pt/C has been achieved. Considering that the Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface exhibits the highest catalytic activity that has ever been detected, the challenge would be to create a nanocatalyst with electronic and morphological properties that mimic the Pt3Ni(111) surface. Therefore in the future, a way to reduce the current value (1/21.0 g of Pt per kW) of Pt-specific power density in a PEMFC without a loss in cell voltage, while also maintaining the maximum power density (W/cm2), would be the engineering of Pt3Ni(111)-skin-like nanocatalysts.
Abstract Genetic surveys reveal the diversity of bacteria and lead to the questioning of species concepts used to categorize bacteria. One difficulty in defining bacterial species arises from the high rates of recombination that results in the transfer of DNA between relatively distantly related bacteria. Barriers to this process, which could be used to define species naturally, are not apparent. Here, we review conceptual models of bacterial speciation and describe our computer simulations of speciation. Our findings suggest that the rate of recombination and its relation to genetic divergence have a strong influence on outcomes. We propose that a distinction be made between clonal divergence and sexual speciation. Hence, to make sense of bacterial diversity, we need data not only from genetic surveys but also from experimental determination of selection pressures and recombination rates and from theoretical models. Bacteria are promiscuous. They often live in environments with an abundant diversity of donor DNA, and studies of the genomes of members of the same, or similar, species indicate the dynamic nature of gene acquisition, loss, and transfer (1). It is probably possible, through a series of intermediates and vectors, to transfer genes between any two bacteria. Besides the illegitimate recombinational process that leads to gene acquisition from distantly related sources, there is convincing evidence that homologous recombination may frequently replace small regions of the genome of a bacterium with those from other members of the same species or from closely related species (2). The rate of homologous recombination varies greatly. In some species it appears to be rare and leads to the evolution of distinct clonal lineages, whereas in others these localized recombinational imports arise much more frequently than mutations (3). In recent years, extensive homologous recombination has been shown to be so widespread that it may be regarded as the norm rather than the exception. Nonetheless, surveys of genetic diversity in the bacterial kingdom are revealing that, far from a continuum mediated by promiscuous gene exchange, bacteria seem to form clusters of genetically related strains (species), at least for those genera studied so far (4-6). There is thus uncertainty regarding the nature of bacterial speciation and the influence that homologous recombination exerts upon it (7). One proposition is that speciation (by which we mean the generation of permanently distinct clusters of closely related bacteria) could arise, not because of fundamental ecological constraints or geographic separation but rather as a consequence of recombination failing more frequently between DNA sequences that are different than between those that are similar (8-10). In experimental studies of recombination in bacteria from widely differing genera, a consistent pattern of decline in the recombination rate as a function of genetic distance has been observed (Fig. 1A) (11). This effect has been shown to be associated with the various mechanisms that detect the sequence similarities between donor and recipient DNA, principally MutS-mediated mismatch repair and RecA-mediated recombination (12-14). RecA is involved in initiating recombination between donor and recipient DNA and is thus essential for recombination, whereas MutS inhibits recombination between mismatched sequences. One mechanism that has received particular attention is the requirement of RecA for minimally efficient processing segments (MEPS), which are short regions of sequence identity located at either end of the donor DNA strand and hypothesized to be required for recombination to occur (15). This mechanism can generate the general relationship seen in Fig. 1A and provides a corroborative estimate for the length of MEPS of between 20 and 30 base pairs (bp) (16). Whatever mechanism underlies the decline in recombination with increasing sequence divergence, this relationship results in constraints on recombination that operates at the genomic level, potentially allowing species distinctness to emerge as a dynamic corollary to diversification and adaptation (8, 9).

(C) Schematic representation of the simulated genomes in a stochastic neutral model. MLST genes are highlighted. Although this picture of speciation driven by recombinational (i.e., sexual) incompatibility is appealing, especially for the parallels it offers with the biological species concept of Mayr (17), the elucidation of the quantitative detail of recombinational incompatibility is only one aspect of the story (or stories) of bacterial speciation. What drives new strains to cross these "soft" genetic barriers and form new species? How distinct must clusters be for this soft barrier to be effective enough to maintain separation and for the evolutionary fate of each cluster to be distinct? Is there a consistent mechanism of speciation that applies to all bacteria, irrespective of the rates and mechanisms of recombination, which are known empirically to be extremely variable? Modeling Bacterial Diversity Genetic surveys of bacterial populations usually provide a static picture of the patterns of genotypic clustering; consequently, exploring the dynamics of populations requires theoretical models studied using computer simulations and analytical approximations. Clustering in natural populations can then be compared with those from simulated populations if the genotypes of strains are defined in the same way. Isolates within bacterial populations are commonly characterized by the alleles at seven housekeeping loci [multilocus sequence typing (MLST)], where each allele corresponds to a different sequence (18). We have developed a model in which strains are defined in the same way and in which alleles change at defined rates by mutation or recombination. We also showed that genetic diversity in several bacterial pathogens could be explained by this simple model of neutral drift (19). The use of neutral models of mutation and drift is not a denial of selection but a recognition that much observed population genetic structure can be explained in simple terms. It makes sense, as a null model, to explore the dynamics of neutral diversification and the conditions under which populations do, or do not, separate into distinct genotypic clusters that mimic the emergence of species. Estimates for the rates of mutation and recombination are available from empirical studies of a variety of bacteria [e.g., (2, 20)], as is the relationship between sequence divergence and recombination rate shown in Fig. 1A. We estimated population mutation rates (denoted ) in the range 1 to 10, whereas recombination rates (denoted ) are more variable, ranging from 0.1 to 100 (19, 20). These values are expressed per gene segment per generation and are related to the underlying biological mutation and recombination rates (denoted m and r, respectively) by a constant known as the effective population size Ne, such that = 2mLNe and = 2rNe. Our estimates of are based on genes approximately L 500 bp long, and if we take a plausible estimate of the DNA mutation rate (m) at 5 * 10-10 per base pair per replication (21), we get a ballpark estimate for the effective population size Ne of 107. The effective population size is not directly related to the census population size but is rather a measure of how much neutral diversity the environment can carry. It may be considerably smaller than the census population size as a result of factors such as regular bottlenecks, genome-wide selective sweeps, or hierarchical structure (22). Consider, for example, an infectious agent such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. At least three factors result in an effective population size many orders of magnitude smaller than the actual number of bacteria. First, the bacterial population is divided into distinct populations within individual humans and is transmitted by small inocula, so that the number of infected people may be a better measure of population size than the number of bacteria. Second, transmission is seasonal, with peaks occurring during the winter months, creating bottlenecks during the low season, so that the effective population size may reflect the number of people infected during these bottlenecks. Third, the human contact network is hierarchically structured into communities, communities of communities, and so on, so that the effective number of people infected is lower than the actual number of people infected (23). Thus, a population of trillions of bacteria can have a low effective population size. Similar considerations may influence effective population sizes in many environments, such as the partitioning of marine bacteria around nutrient-rich coastal regions, seasonal regulation caused by the "bloom-bust" cycle of algal nutrient availability, and local clustering of populations around small particles of nutrients (24). In general, most natural populations of bacteria live in structured environments with well-defined patches of growth, where serious limits exist on the dispersion of novel types between patches. Establishing plausible estimates for Ne for a diverse range of bacteria, as well as identifying the factors that affect it, should be a research priority. To explore speciation, we extended our previous model (19) to simulate simplified genomes (Fig. 1C), with an effective population size Ne = 105 andapopulationmutationrate = 2, and defined each strain by the alleles at a larger number of loci (70) to counter the effect that occasional recombination at a single locus has in distorting relationships between otherwise divergent or similar strains (25). This model ignores several heterogeneities that may arise in populations (e.g., fitness, ecology, and recombination rate) but may nonetheless provide a preliminary description of the generation of diversity by drift. Our choice of parameters and model structure is an inevitable compromise between plausibility and computational limitations, achieved principally by reducing the effective population size and by using an approximation algorithm for modeling mutation of DNA sequences (25). The Clonal-Sexual Threshold The most salient feature of this simple model is a sharp transition in population structure with increasing rates of homologous recombination. When recombination rates are low, the population is effectively clonal in structure. In some sense, each clone has a separate evolutionary fate, because novel alleles that arise are unlikely to spread horizontally through the population. A feature of neutral population structure in the clonal region is strong genotypic clustering (Fig. 2, A and B). These clusters are unstable, and the long-term dynamics are characterized by a constant process in which major clusters regularly emerge by chance, split, drift apart, and eventually become extinct (Fig. 2C).

All populations are evolving under neutral drift and are homogeneously mixing. (A, D, and G) Genetic maps, which are determined by principal coordinate analysis (36), represent the genetic distances between 1000 randomly chosen isolates from the simulated population after 106 generations have elapsed. Coordinates are expressed in units of sequence divergence. (B, E, and H) An alternative way to represent clustering is the distribution of sequence divergence between pairs of isolates in the population. The thin lines show the distance between five random strains and all the other strains in the sample, whereas the thick red line shows the distribution of all the pairwise distances. Where there is little clustering (E), all pairwise distances are similar and the distribution has a single peak; where there is strong clustering [(B) and (H)], the distribution has multiple peaks corresponding to pairwise comparisons within and between clusters. (C, F, and I) Distribution of the pairwise comparisons evolving over 106 generations. To normalize the distribution, pairs of isolates are compared for the number of alleles that are different, between 0 and 70, rather than for the proportion of base pairs as in (B), (E), and (H). The height of the distribution is represented by color shade, ranging from black (0.0) to red (>0.1), so that peaks in (B), (E), and (H) correspond to red shaded areas in (C), (F), and (I). (C) and (I) show clusters moving apart, visible as red peaks moving up through time. When clusters split, a new peak appears at the bottom; extinctions are apparent from peaks disappearing. (F) shows instead more stable population structure, with a stable diffuse cluster being maintained throughout the simulation. Parameter values for and , the population mutation and recombination rates, are = 2, = 0.01 [(A) to (C)], = 20 * 10-18x, where x is the sequence divergence [(D) to (F)]. We also explored under which conditions clustering could occur in the presence of high recombination rates [(G) to (I)]. Clusters with high within-cluster recombination can be generated, mimicking spontaneous speciation [(G) to (I)], but require that recombination rate declines as a function of sequence divergence at a very rapid rate uncharacteristic of most bacteria studied to date, such that = 20 * 10-300x. When recombination rates are increased to values between one-fourth and twice the mutation rate (per locus), a threshold is passed where clusters no longer diverge but are constantly reabsorbed into the parent population by the cohesive force of recombination. Alleles can succeed through horizontal spread even when the parental lineage does not. The degree of clustering is much reduced compared with the clonal situation (Fig. 2, D and E), and dynamic analysis (Fig. 2F) reveals that the clustering that does occur is transient. It is worth noting that in both situations, the degree of diversity at each locus is the same and is governed by the balance between extinction and mutation. The sexual population contains more distinct genotypes, based on different combinations of a similar number of alleles. Recombination is frequent enough that the fate of alleles at one locus is not tied to their association with alleles at other loci. In the clonal situation, in contrast, clusters regularly become extinct (Fig. 2C), and extinction of clones is the principal regulator of diversity as a whole. Clustering can be defined as over-dispersion of the genetic distances between isolates (Fig. 2, B, E, and H), and a measure of this is the index of association (26). In earlier work, we showed how to calculate this index for neutral models (without the dependence on sequence divergence of Fig. 1) (19), and we have shown that the threshold between clonal and sexual regimes holds for a wide range of parameters (20). The transition between clonal and sexual population structure is studied in more detail in the accompanying
Abstract Primary pneumonic plague is transmitted easily, progresses rapidly, and causes high mortality, but the mechanisms by which Yersinia pestis overwhelms the lungs are largely unknown. We show that the plasminogen activator Pla is essential for Y. pestis to cause primary pneumonic plague but is less important for dissemination during pneumonic plague than during bubonic plague. Experiments manipulating its temporal expression showed that Pla allows Y. pestis to replicate rapidly in the airways, causing a lethal fulminant pneumonia; if unexpressed, inflammation is aborted, and lung repair is activated. Inhibition of Pla expression prolonged the survival of animals with the disease, offering a therapeutic option to extend the period during which antibiotics are effective. Of the three species of Yersinia pathogenic to humans, Y. pestis is infamous owing to its ability to cause plague. Although usually transmitted by an arthropod vector, it is during cases of secondary pneumonic plague that Y. pestis can be spread from person to person through the inhalation of respiratory droplets carrying the bacteria (1). This method of transmission may initiate an epidemic of primary pneumonic plague, which is fatal if not treated early. Pneumonic plague is the most likely form to result in the event of a biowarfare attack with aerosolized Y. pestis (2). Yersinia virulence in mammals requires the Ysc type III secretion system (T3SS), which is shared among all three pathogenic species (3). Unlike Y. pestis, Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis are foodborne pathogens and usually result in self-limiting gastrointestinal infections (4-6). Thus, the presence of the Ysc T3SS alone is not sufficient to cause a rapidly progressing respiratory infection. Y. pestis also carries pPCP1, a 9.5-kb plasmid that encodes the plasminogen activator Pla, a surface protease that is thought to promote plasmin degradation of fibrin clots (1, 7). In models of bubonic plague, Pla promotes the invasion of Y. pestis from subcutaneous sites of inoculation into the lymphatic system and deeper tissues but is dispensable for growth at the site of inoculation (8, 9). When introduced by aerosol, Y. pestis lacking Pla was reported to be equivalent or near equivalent in virulence to wild-type by median lethal dose (LD50) analysis (10, 11), but the progression of lung and systemic disease has never been evaluated in a model of primary pneumonic plague. On the basis of these studies, we predicted that respiratory infection with a strain of Y. pestis lacking Pla would proceed normally in the lungs and result in a lethal pneumonia but that fibrin deposition would restrict the ability of bacteria to escape the respiratory system. We infected C57BL/6 mice intranasally with wild-type Y. pestis CO92, an isogenic Y. pestis strain lacking Pla (CO92 pla), or the pla strain complemented with the coding sequence for Pla. Mice given wild-type Y. pestis CO92, a strain isolated from a fatal case of pneumonic plague (12), succumbed to the infection in a highly synchronous manner. In contrast, only 50% of the mice infected with the pla strain developed terminal plague after 7 days, and the rate at which the mice died was less synchronous than the rate of those infected with the wild-type strain (Fig. 1A). Complementation of the mutant with the coding sequence for Pla fully restored virulence. Thus, the lack of Pla substantially delayed the time to death resulting from respiratory infection.

The limit of detection is indicated by a dashed line. Symbols below the limit of detection represent mice that survived but did not have detectable numbers of bacteria; an "X" indicates a mouse that succumbed to the infection. A solid line indicates the median of CFU recovered. *P = 0.037, **P = 0.002, and ***P pla (white). C57BL/6 mice were infected as above, and at various times lungs were excised and weighed. *P = 0.01 and **P pla-infected mice was significantly altered (Fig. 1, B and C). After 24 hours, 100- to 1000-fold fewer bacteria were recovered from the lungs of pla-infected mice compared with the lungs with wild-type infection. Over the next 2 days, the numbers of pla bacteria in the lungs did not substantially change, whereas wild-type bacteria increased by almost 6 logs. In contrast, we detected bacteria in the spleens of all mice by 72 hours, indicating that escape of the pla strain from the lungs to distal organs still occurred (Fig. 1C). Indeed, at later times, one of five mice had a bacterial burden approaching 108 to 109 colony-forming units (CFU) in the spleen. This corresponded with increased numbers of bacteria in the lungs; however, this is likely due to the recirculation of systemic organisms back into the lungs (13) rather than outgrowth of bacteria in this organ. These data show that Pla controls the proliferation of Y. pestis in the lungs but is not essential for bacteria to disseminate. This is a distinct phenotype from that attributed to Pla in models of bubonic plague: When Pla-negative Y. pestis is introduced subcutaneously, dissemination is dramatically reduced, but bacterial outgrowth at the local site of infection is unaffected (8, 9). Indeed, we show that rates of dissemination from the initial site of colonization to the spleen were substantially increased when Pla-negative bacteria were introduced intranasally compared with the subcutaneous route (table S2). This may be due to the highly vascularized nature of the lung, allowing escape of a few Pla-negative bacteria through an alveolar capillary and thus initiating systemic infection. A hallmark of fatal bacterial pneumonia is the development of edema in the lungs, which can be measured by a change in gross lung weight as fluid and cells contribute to increased mass of the organ. Although mouse lungs infected with wild-type Y. pestis weighed significantly more than uninfected lungs, the lungs of mice infected with the pla strain of Y. pestis showed no change in weight, even after 7 days (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the death of mice infected with this strain is not due to pneumonia but rather is caused by systemic infection. Our results, therefore, may explain the similar LD50 values for wild-type and Pla-negative strains when inhaled, even though Y. pestis requires Pla to cause a severe pneumonia. We also examined lung histology of wild-type and mutant Y. pestis-infected mice to resolve an existing controversy regarding pathology and inflammation at the site of infection (8, 9, 13). An influx of inflammatory cells was detected in the lungs in both wild-type and pla infections 36 hours after inoculation; in both cases, the predominant infiltrating cell type was polymorphonuclear (Fig. 2). Although the size of the pulmonary lesions in the wild-type infection increased over time, resulting in tissue destruction and hemorrhage, the foci of inflammation in mice infected with CO92 pla remained relatively constant and restricted. In addition, we examined infected lung sections by using immunofluorescence with an antibody against Y. pestis. Numerous extracellular bacteria were associated with inflammation in the lungs of wild-type-infected mice, but relatively few bacteria were detected in the pla infection and were restricted to the much smaller inflammatory lesions (Fig. 2). Thus, both bacterial outgrowth and subsequent inflammation in the lungs were dependent on the Pla surface protease. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2. Histology and presence of bacteria in the lungs of mice during the progression of pneumonic plague. Mice were infected intranasally; at various times, lungs were inflated and fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin, and 5-1/2m sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or a Y. pestis antibody. The images shown are representative of experiments repeated twice. Scale bars indicate 200 1/2m. These results suggest that host immunity controls the pulmonary infection without developing an overwhelming inflammatory reaction to Pla-negative bacteria. Therefore, we assessed the amount of immune activation in the lungs by using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to determine changes in transcript quantities of multiple inflammatory mediators. Consistent with our previous observations (13), mice infected with CO92 remained unresponsive early in the infection but showed significant cytokine up-regulation by 48 hours (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the cytokine transcript numbers in the lungs of mice infected with pla were also relatively unchanged early in the infection. After 48 hours, however, cytokine transcript numbers in response to pla were unchanged or only slightly increased, and by the following day of infection transcript numbers for most cytokines decreased, suggesting down-regulation of the inflammatory response to pla. Thus, the data reveal that, in the absence of Pla, an anti-inflammatory state is maintained in the lungs and the infection is unable to progress to the pro-inflammatory phase that we described previously (13).

PCNA-positive cells (arrows) are present in the lungs of pla-infected mice but largely absent in the wild-type infection. Extranuclear granular staining in the CO92-infected lungs correlate with the presence of bacteria. Scale bars, 50 1/2m. That cytokine transcript amounts appeared to stabilize and then decrease in the pla-infected mice suggested the pulmonary inflammatory lesions were resolving. We immunostained infected lungs for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a marker for host cellular DNA synthesis (14). Whereas the cells of wild-type-infected lungs were almost uniformly PCNA-negative (Fig. 3B), large numbers of PCNA-positive cells were present in pla-infected mice (Fig. 3C), indicating active cell proliferation and regeneration of tissue in the lungs. Lung repair at this stage of the infection is further evidence that fatalities among pla-infected mice are not a consequence of airway inflammation or damage but instead are the result of systemic spread of the bacteria. If Pla alone controls the ability of Y. pestis to cause pneumonic plague, we hypothesized that experimental induction of pla expression midway during the aborted pulmonary disease would be sufficient to turn the nonpneumonic infection into a pneumonic one. To test this, we adapted the tetracycline-responsive promoter system (15) to exogenously control gene expression in Y. pestis during infection (Materials and Methods and figs. S1 and S2). We cultured the pla strain of Y. pestis carrying pla under control of the tetracycline-responsive promoter (Y. pestis CO92 pla Ptet-pla, strain YP138) in pla-repressing conditions (i.e., absence of anhydrotetracycline, or ATC). Thirty-six hours after intranasal inoculation, we induced pla expression by injecting ATC and then followed the progression of the infection. Bacteria in the pla-repressed state established a nonprogressive lung infection in a manner similar to that of the pla-infected mice. However, once ATC was administered and Pla expression was up-regulated, the condition of these mice quickly converted to a disease with all the features of pneumonic plague: rapid proliferation of bacteria with development of visible microcolonies (Fig. 4, A and B), unrestricted inflammatory infiltrate, tissue damage (Fig. 4C), and shortened time to death. Thus, the absence of Pla stalls the development of disease in the early anti-inflammatory phase but does not eliminate the potential of these organisms to cause pneumonic plague. Ultimately, the block in the progression of infection by the respiratory route is completely reversible by the expression of Pla. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 4.

See Materials and Methods for details. The bar beneath the graph approximates the period at which pla induction ends and repression begins. One hypothesis of the mechanism by which Pla facilitates the invasive nature of Y. pestis is that the protease converts host plasminogen into plasmin while degrading the plasmin inhibitor 2-antiplasmin, releasing bacteria from the entrapment of fibrin clots (16, 17). Indeed, recent evidence has shown that fibrin deposition is an important means of immune control for a variety of pathogens (18-20), and thus the subversion of the coagulation cascade may be a notable virulence mechanism. Consistent with this, we show that the plasminogen-activating activity of Pla is essential to Y. pestis virulence in the pulmonary system (Materials and Methods and fig. S3). Additionally, fibrin(ogen) deposition can be detected in the lungs of mice infected with either the wild-type or the pla strain, but the pattern and extent of fibrin(ogen) immunostaining is substantially altered (fig. S4). We cannot exclude, however, the possibility that other targets of Pla activity may also contribute to the development of primary pneumonic plague. Nonetheless, the role of Pla during pneumonic plague may help explain how Y. pestis acquired the ability to cause a rapid, severe respiratory infection and be transmitted from person to person by the aerosol route, whereas Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica did not. Interestingly, the altered syndrome we observed with a Pla-negative strain is similar to case descriptions from the early 20th-century Manchurian epidemics in which aerosol-acquired plague resulted in fatal sepsis before a local lung disease could develop (21). The critical role for Pla suggests that its inhibition could offer a therapeutic advantage, particularly because the rapid progression of pneumonic plague leaves little time for effective treatment. We tested this experimentally by infecting mice with the Pla-inducible Y. pestis strain YP138 prepared in the presence of ATC. We then provided ATC to the animals for only the first day of the infection, allowing the ATC to be cleared and pla expression to be repressed for the remainder of the experiment. The time until death was delayed when the Pla-induced state was switched to a Pla-repressed state during the infection (Fig. 4D); in fact, the kinetics more closely resemble those of a pla infection. This suggests that exogenous inhibition of Pla during primary pneumonic plague may indeed prolong the survival of the affected individual, expanding the window during which antibiotics could be successfully administered to treat the disease.
Abstract A number of brain systems have been implicated in addictive behavior, but none have yet been shown to be necessary for maintaining the addiction to cigarette smoking. We found that smokers with brain damage involving the insula, a region implicated in conscious urges, were more likely than smokers with brain damage not involving the insula to undergo a disruption of smoking addiction, characterized by the ability to quit smoking easily, immediately, without relapse, and without persistence of the urge to smoke. This result suggests that the insula is a critical neural substrate in the addiction to smoking. Cigarette smoking, the most common preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world (1), is an addictive behavior. Despite being aware of negative consequences, many smokers have difficulty quitting, and even those who quit experience urges to smoke and tend to relapse (2, 3). These phenomena appear to arise from long-term adaptations within specific neural systems. Subcortical regions, such as the amygdala, the nucleus accumbens, and the mesotelencephalic dopamine system, have been shown in animal models to promote the self-administration of drugs of abuse (4, 5). Functional imaging studies have shown that exposure to drug-associated cues activates cortical regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the insula (6-13). Among these regions, the insula is of particular interest because of its potential role in conscious urges. The insula has been proposed to function in conscious emotional feelings through its role in the representation of bodily (interoceptive) states (14-16). Activity within the insula on both sides of the brain has been shown to correlate with subjective cue-induced drug urges (7, 8, 11). It has also been shown that a high amount of activity in the right insula during a simple decision-making task is associated with relapse to drug use (17). Given its potential role in cognitive and emotional processes that promote drug use, the question arises as to whether the insula is necessary for maintaining addiction to smoking. We hypothesized that the insula is a critical neural substrate in the addiction to smoking. We predicted, therefore, that damage to the insula would disrupt addiction to smoking. We identified 19 cigarette smokers who had acquired brain damage that included the insula (18). Six of these patients had right insula damage, and 13 had left insula damage. We also identified a group of 50 cigarette smokers who had acquired damage that did not include the insula. All of these patients had been smoking more than five cigarettes per day for more than 2 years at the time of lesion onset. The groups were matched with respect to several characteristics, including the number of cigarettes they were smoking at lesion onset, the total number of years they had been smoking at lesion onset, and the etiology of their brain damage (Fig. 1 and table S1).

(Top) All patients. The horizontal line marks the transverse section of the brain shown in the top row. The vertical line marks the coronal section shown in the bottom row. (Middle) Patients with lesions that involved the insula. (Bottom) Patients with lesions that did not involve the insula. First, we performed a logistic regression analysis in which the dependent variable was whether or not patients quit smoking some time after lesion onset (i.e., whether or not they were smoking at the time of the study). The independent variable of interest was the extent of damage in the insula on a given side. An estimate of the total extent of the lesion was entered as a nuisance covariable (Materials and Methods). We found that the likelihood of quitting smoking after a lesion in either the right or the left insula was not significantly higher than the likelihood of quitting after a noninsula lesion (odds ratio = 2.94, 2 = 2.74, and P = 0.10). When we examined the right and left insulae separately, we found that the likelihood of quitting smoking was not significantly higher after a right insula lesion than after a noninsula lesion (odds ratio = 2.53, 2 = 2.98, and P = 0.08), nor was it significantly higher after a left insula lesion compared with after a noninsula lesion (odds ratio = 1.44, 2 = 1.12, and P =0.29) (Fig. 2 and table S3). One explanation of this null finding is that, whereas the insula-lesioned patients may have quit smoking due to a disruption of smoking addiction, the noninsula-lesioned patients may have quit smoking at a similar rate because they were concerned about the negative consequences of smoking. Simply determining whether the patients were smoking at the time of the study did not address this distinction. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

(B) Pie charts illustrating the proportion of patients in each anatomical group who fell into each of the behavioral categories. The colors correspond to the behavioral group depicted in (A). These actual proportions are shown in the Materials and Methods. The proportion of patients with a disruption of smoking addiction was higher among both left insula-lesioned patients and right insula-lesioned patients compared with among noninsula-lesioned patients. To more specifically assess a disruption of smoking addiction, we asked all of the patients who quit smoking after lesion onset a set of questions aimed at their recollection of the experience of quitting. Patients were classified as having had a disruption of smoking addiction if they fulfilled all four of the following criteria: (i) reporting quitting smoking less than 1 day after lesion onset, (ii) reporting that they did not start smoking again after they quit, (iii) rating the difficulty of quitting as less than three on a scale of one to seven, and (iv) reporting feeling no urges to smoke since quitting. According to these criteria, 16 of the patients who quit smoking after lesion onset were classified as having a disruption of smoking addiction. The 16 quitters who failed to meet all four of these criteria, along with all 37 nonquitters, were considered to have no disruption of smoking addiction (Fig. 2). We performed a logistic regression in which the dependent variable was whether or not patients underwent a disruption of smoking addiction after lesion onset as defined by the above criteria. As before, the independent variable of interest was the extent of damage to the insula on a given side, whereas the estimate of the total extent of the lesion was entered as a nuisance covariable. We found that the likelihood of having a disruption of smoking addiction after a lesion in either the right or the left insula was significantly higher than the likelihood of having a disruption of smoking addiction after a non-insula lesion (odds ratio = 22.05, 2 = 16.64, and P = 0.0005). When we examined the right and left insulae separately, we found that the likelihood of having a disruption of smoking addiction was significantly higher after a right insula lesion than after a noninsula lesion (odds ratio = 10.87, 2 = 12.90, and P = 0.0003) and was also significantly higher after a left insula lesion compared with after a noninsula lesion (odds ratio = 3.61, 2 = 10.33, and P = 0.001) (Fig. 2 and table S3). Although it appears that effects may be somewhat larger with right insula lesions compared with left insula lesions, the sample sizes were too small to confirm this statistically. We then conducted a similar logistic regression that included only the patients in our sample who quit smoking after lesion onset (thus, we were not required to assume that patients who continued to smoke after lesion onset had an intact smoking addiction). We found that five of five of the patients who quit smoking after a right insula lesion and seven of eight of the patients who quit smoking after a left insula lesion met the criteria for having a disruption of smoking addiction, compared to 4 of 19 of the patients who quit smoking after a noninsula lesion (right insula-lesioned patients versus noninsula-lesioned patients: odds ratio = 6.55, 2 = 7.76, and P = 0.005; left insula-lesioned patients versus noninsula-lesioned patients: odds ratio = 7.19, 2 = 10.06, and P = 0.002). Putting the right and left sides together, 12 of 13 patients who quit smoking after a lesion in the insula did so with a disruption of smoking addiction. Relative to noninsula-lesioned patients, this translates into an odds ratio of 136.49 as estimated by the logistic regression (2 = 15.48 and P = 0.00008) (Fig. 2 and table S3). In our sample, the patients with insula lesions tended also to have damage in adjacent areas (Fig. 1). This raises the question of whether the observed effects were necessarily due to insula damage or whether they required damage in one or more areas adjacent to the insula. To address this issue, we performed a region-by-region logistic regression analysis that estimated, for each region of the brain that we sampled, the likelihood of having a disruption of smoking addiction after a lesion that included the region compared to a lesion that did not include the region. This analysis included all of the patients in the sample. We found that the only regions in which lesions were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of having a disruption of smoking addiction were the right and left insulae (Fig. 3). On the left side, there were near-significant effects in regions adjacent to the insula, such as the putamen. We cannot rule out the possibility that some of these regions independently or cumulatively play a role in smoking addiction. For example, evidence from animal studies suggests that the dorsal striatum, which includes the putamen, is involved in learning and expression of drug-use habits (4). However, for most of these regions the patients with lesions who had a disruption of smoking addiction also had damage in the insula (table S4), suggesting that apparent effects of lesions in these regions were due to a bystander effect. We did find four patients who had a disruption of smoking addiction after suffering from brain damage that did not involve the insula. When we examined their lesions, we found that each of them had damage in a unique set of regions (table S5). This raises the possibility that certain patients may undergo a disruption of smoking addiction as a general effect of suffering from a brain injury.

The color of each region corresponds to a 2 statistic given the sign of regression coefficient obtained from the logistic regression analysis. The only regions that were assigned a color were those for which the number of patients was sufficient to detect a statistically significant effect (Materials and Methods). Regions for which there was a statistically significant association between a lesion and a disruption of smoking addiction (P < 0.05, uncorrected) are highlighted in red. The insula is the only region on either side of the brain where a lesion was significantly associated with a disruption of smoking addiction. There were nonsignificant effects in regions on the left side that are adjacent to the insula; however, patients with damage in these regions also tended to have damage in the insula (Materials and Methods). The likelihood of having a disruption of smoking addiction was not increased after damage in the orbitofrontal cortex. The results indicate that smokers who acquire insula damage are very likely to quit smoking easily and immediately and to remain abstinent. In addition, smokers with insula damage are very likely to no longer experience conscious urges to smoke after quitting. These findings are consistent with previous functional imaging evidence showing that activity in the insula is correlated with subjective drug urges (7, 8, 11). Additionally, the results provide evidence that subjective urges are an important factor in maintaining smoking addiction. However, urges may not be the only factor that promotes smoking. Recent theories of addiction propose that usual drug use in addicted individuals is driven primarily by automatic or implicit motivational processes, such as habits (4) and incentive salience wanting (19). Conscious urges come into play when there is an impediment to drug use, such as an attempt to quit or to resist relapse (20). The present results are consistent with this view. However, it remains to be seen whether insula damage spares the automatic tendency to smoke. It also remains to be seen whether patients with insula damage still obtain pleasure from smoking, because pleasure and urge may be dissociable facets of smoking reward (19). Our sample included a number of patients with damage to the orbitofrontal cortex (Fig. 1), a region that, like the insula, has been implicated by functional imaging studies to play a role in conscious drug urges (6, 8, 9, 11-13). We found no association between lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex and a disruption of smoking addiction (Fig. 3 and table S4). One explanation of this result is that smokers who acquire orbitofrontal damage experience a reduction in conscious urges but continue to smoke because their automatic tendency to smoke is still intact. At the same time, these patients may have a low likelihood of attempting to quit smoking after suffering from a brain injury, because the orbitofrontal region is critical for decisions that override the automatic tendency to obtain immediate rewards in order to avoid future negative consequences (21, 22). Insula-lesioned patients, in contrast, may not have such severe decisionmaking deficits and thus may be likely to attempt to quit smoking after suffering from a brain injury. The results of this study suggest that the insula is a critical neural substrate for the urge to smoke, although they do not in themselves indicate why the insula, a region known to play a role in the representation of the bodily states (16), would play such an important role in urge. A clue may be provided by the account of one patient in our sample who quit smoking immediately after he suffered a stroke that damaged his left insula. He stated that he quit because his "body forgot the urge to smoke" (23). His experience suggests that the insula plays a role in the feeling that smoking is a bodily need. Indeed, much of the pleasure and satiety that is obtained from smoking is derived from its bodily effects, in particular its impact on the airway (24, 25). In addition, nicotine withdrawal is associated with changes in autonomic and endocrine function (26, 27), which may contribute to its unpleasantness. Current evidence suggests that the insula plays a role in conscious feelings by anticipating the bodily effects of emotional events (14, 15). The insula may therefore function in the conscious urge to smoke by anticipating pleasure from the airway effects of smoking and/or relief from the aversive autonomic effects of nicotine withdrawal. Thus, damage to the insula could lead a smoker to feel that his or her body has "forgotten" the urge to smoke. An important question pertains to whether insula lesions cause a disruption of motivated behaviors other than smoking. In a follow-up survey, we found that none of the patients with insula damage who had a disruption of smoking addiction admitted to any reductions in their pleasure from eating, their desire to eat, or their intake of food. This does not preclude the possibility that these patients had some impairment of taste perception (28, 29) or had deficits in other motivated behaviors that we did not assess. One possibility is that motivated behaviors that are fundamental to survival, such as eating, are supported by redundant neural mechanisms that are difficult to disrupt with a lesion in a single brain region. A related possibility is that the insula is critical for behaviors whose bodily effects become pleasurable through learning; although the bodily effects of eating are inherently pleasurable, the bodily effects of smoking are initially aversive and become pleasurable as addiction develops (25). It would be interesting to see how insula damage affects other learned pleasures. Our findings suggest that therapies that modulate the function of the insula will be useful in helping smokers quit. For example, sensory replacements for smoking, such as denicotinized cigarettes and irritant inhalers, are highly effective in reducing urges and promoting abstinence (30, 31). Such therapies may work by engaging sensory representations of the airway within the insula, thereby satisfying the "bodily need" to smoke. Future pharmacologic therapies may target neurotransmitter receptors that are expressed within the insula. In addition, the efficacy of various smoking cessation therapies may be monitored by measuring activity within the insula with functional brain imaging. Lastly, the findings of this study demonstrate that conscious feelings, such as urges, are an important component of addiction.
Abstract Quantum mechanical analysis of electron tunneling in nine thermally fluctuating cytochrome b562 derivatives reveals two distinct protein-mediated coupling limits. A structure-insensitive regime arises for redox partners coupled through dynamically averaged multiple-coupling pathways (in seven of the nine derivatives) where heme-edge coupling leads to the multiple-pathway regime. A structure-dependent limit governs redox partners coupled through a dominant pathway (in two of the nine derivatives) where axial-ligand coupling generates the single-pathway limit and slower rates. This two-regime paradigm provides a unified description of electron transfer rates in 26 ruthenium-modified heme and blue-copper proteins, as well as in numerous photosynthetic proteins. Many biological pathways depend on the facilitation of electron transfer (ET) processes by proteins (1-14). At the simplest level, this acceleration in rate can be explained by empirical models that omit the details of protein structure and describe the fact that proteins lower the barrier to electron tunneling by about 3 eV relative to that of vacuum tunneling (1, 14). However, ET rates can be slower or faster in different proteins, despite the electron's traveling a similar distance between donors and acceptors (RDA) (1-3). These rate differences can arise because tunneling is faster through covalent bonds than through weak or nonbonded contacts (10), and the composition of the coupling medium between donor and acceptor varies with the primary, secondary, and tertiary structure of the protein (1, 2, 10). The simplest model that accounts for such structural effects on ET rates is the pathway model (10), which identifies the most facile coupling routes between the donor and acceptor. Packing-density models analyze atom density between the donor and acceptor. The predictions of the pathway and packing-density models are nearly the same (4, 15). Nonetheless, there are many examples where an even simpler exponential model (14) (1) , where kET is the ET rate and is an exponential decay constant, can account for the observed ET rates without including three-dimensional details of protein structure. The limits of validity for these simple tunneling models have been poorly understood, and understanding has been further hampered by the lack of sufficiently detailed data sets on ET rates for the same protein that would allow for meaningful comparisons; in comparing ET rates between different proteins, it is difficult to separate the electron-tunneling factors from the nuclear factors, or Marcus factors (16), that arise in the ET theory (1, 2). We have now analyzed a recent set of tunneling-limited ET rates obtained by Winkler and Gray for a Ru-modified heme protein [cytochrome (cyt) b562]. The exponential distance-decay model accounts for some but not all of the observed rate dependences (17, 18). We provide an explanation for the different rate behaviors in this protein, which can also account for ET kinetic data in other Ru-modified heme proteins (including cyt c and myoglobin). Here, we argue that some protein structures generate exponential decay of coupling with distance (as if the proteins were structureless tunneling barriers) by dynamically averaging multiple-coupling pathways. Other protein structures, in contrast, retain pathway-specific coupling characteristics that may be very different from the "average" protein coupling for that RDA value. We explain why the protein-mediated coupling falls either in the pathway or average-barrier regime, and we also find that a simple metric-the coupling coherence parameter (19)-provides a reliable indicator of the coupling mechanism. We restrict our discussion to unimolecular ET between sites within a protein, although interprotein ET appears to be even more sensitive to structure than unimolecular ET (11, 12). We briefly review the two structured-protein models (1, 10). The pathway model predicts (2) where represents a product, mu bond 1/20.6 and space 1/21 A-1 are decay parameters associated with the dominant-coupling route from donor to acceptor through a combination of bonded and nonbonded contacts, rj is the length of each through-space contact, and r0 is 1.4A. The pathway-based rate is well approximated by means of an atomic packing-density model (4, 15) (3) where the parameters describe tunneling decay through bond or space, and 1 - f space is the fraction of space between the donor and acceptor that is filled with atoms (4). The pathway and packing-density rates (Eqs. 2 and 3) include explicit information about the protein fold that is not included in the simple exponential model (square-barrier tunneling model), which uses a single fitted value. Fully quantum treatments sum together contributions to the tunneling rate that arise from the multiplicity of donor-acceptor (D-A) pathways that couple donor to acceptor (1, 2). In conformationally flexible systems, the mean square (ensemble-averaged) D-A coupling determines the rate (20-22) (4) Here, we examine the tunneling-limited ET kinetics for Ru-modified cyt b562 (Fig. 1A) (18); each derivative explores the tunneling-mediation characteristics of a distinct protein region. All but two of these rates fit a simple square-barrier tunneling model (Fig. 1B). Two rates fall two orders of magnitude below the square-barrier (exponential distance-decay) model for tunneling in this protein. The ET kinetics in cyt b562 mirrors previous observations in Ru-modified cyt c [one of eight tunneling-limited rates is two orders of magnitude below an exponential fit (17)] and in myoglobin [one of three tunneling-limited rates is orders of magnitude slower than expected based on distance analysis (17)]. Cyt c data appear in fig. S1. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. (A) Ribbon diagram indicating the positions of the nine Ru-modified His sites on cyt b562. (B) Experimentally measured tunneling-limited ET rates for each of these nine cyt b562 derivatives (18). The His12 and His73 derivatives have anomalously slow rates that fall well below an average exponential (square-barrier tunneling) model, which are fit here with a decay constant of 1.3 A-1. We first used a previously developed ab initio Hartree-Fock method to compute ET rates in these cyt b562 systems (23, 24). The correlation between computed and observed ET rates appears in fig. S2. Except for the longest-distance derivative (His86), the measured and computed rates agree within a factor of four. This order of magnitude agreement, including a satisfactory description of the anomalously slow ET kinetics in the His12 and His73 derivatives, indicates that theory describes the essential aspects of ET kinetics in these complex systems. The computations include protein conformational averaging, solvation, and averaging of couplings over multiple ligand-field states with the use of methods described previously (23). The calculations explicitly include multiple-pathway interferences, without making empirical assumptions that are associated with dominant pathways or packing density. We now examine the physical origin of the two slow ET rates, as well as the simple (exponential) distance dependence for the other seven derivatives. To perform this analysis, we computed D-A interactions for protein structure shapshots taken from classical molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. Because the number of calculations needed for this analysis is large, we used an extended-Huckel Hamiltonian. Extended-Huckel analysis of D-A interactions in proteins has been used successfully in previous studies of Stuchebrukhov and Marcus (25), Kakitani (26), Onuchic (6), and others. Our analysis assumes metal-localized states to describe the Fe2+ Ru3+ ET (17). The string of computed coupling interactions allows us to calculate the Balabin-Onuchic coherence parameter, (19), for the ruthenated proteins. We expect C to be very small when numerous interfering coupling pathways contribute to the D-A interaction. In this limit, only average characteristics of the protein fold determine the ET rate. In contrast, when C is near unity, a dominant-coupling pathway mediates tunneling, and the observed rate is characteristic only of that pathway's structure. Indeed, the His12 and His73 derivatives of cyt b562 have C parameters of 0.6 and 0.5, respectively, whereas all other derivatives have C values of 0.1 or less (table S2). Coupling values along 100-ps MD trajectories for His12, His70, and His73 appear in Fig. 2. The coupling values along the MD trajectory for the His73 (C =0.5) and His12 (C = 0.6) derivatives rarely change sign (Fig. 2, A and B), which is characteristic of the dominant pathway regime. The His70 derivative [C = 4 * 10-3] has a coupling value that fluctuates about zero and a mean coupling value squared (2) that is orders of magnitude smaller than the mean squared coupling value (). This small C regime is characteristic of multiple interfering coupling pathways of comparable strength, so the value is averaged over many pathways and is characteristic of the overall protein fold rather than of a single dominant-coupling pathway. In contrast, coupling in the large C regime is determined by the structure of the dominant-coupling pathway. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

Note the frequent sign flips in (C), which are consistent with a multiple-pathway mechanism. In (A) and (B), 2 differs by only about afactoroftwo from . Geometry snapshots were captured each 1 ps and input to the extended-Huckel coupling calculations. What aspects of structure in a single protein can generate this substantial difference in mechanism? Simple tunneling-pathway analysis of the cyt b562 His12 and His73 derivatives provides the answer. The two large C-parameter (dominant pathway) structures have coupling pathways linked to the heme through an axial ligand, but seven other derivatives each have surface Ru complexes that are coupled electronically by multiple pathways to the heme edge. The tunneling-pathway analysis (fig. S3) reveals this aspect of protein connectivity. Because of the large size of the heme-edge "target," coupling into the heme edge in cyt b562 generates multiple interfering pathways with mean squared values that reflect average coupling characteristics of the many pathways. The axial-ligand pathway derivatives, in contrast, have a smaller number of sizable coupling pathways leading to the heme (Fig. 3), because coupling routes must proceed through one single metal-ligand pathway bottleneck. In cyt b562, this connectivity gives rise to single-pathway (large C value) mechanisms. Moveover, the axial ligand's van der Waals volume apparently serves to minimize the presence of multiple coupling routes to the prophyrin ring face. This contrasts with the large circumference heme-edge access provided by noncovalent interactions. In the case of cyt b562 (and for other Ru proteins, as described below), pure axial pathways have large C values (i.e., dominant pathways), are poorly "wired" to the heme, and produce slow tunneling-limited rates. It appears that dynamical averaging over many coupling pathways operates in cyt b562 for all heme-edge-coupled derivatives, producing simple (exponential) decay with distance as described by Eq. 1.

Pruned protein media [5% cutoff criterion (23)] for His70 (average-medium or multiple-pathway regime, small C parameter) and His73 (single-pathway regime, large C parameter). Both proteins have ET distances of 1/220 A metal-to-metal. The strongest single pathways are noted with solid and dashed lines. Spheres are shown on atoms included in the quantum tunneling analysis (23). Is the observation of weak single-pathway (large C) axial coupling and strong multiple-pathway heme-edge coupling (small C) in cyt b562 relevant to other Ru-modified heme proteins and to native proteins? The one anomalously slow ET derivative in the Ru-cyt c family is the His72 derivative (fig. S1) (17), and the dominant-coupling pathway to the heme is routed via an axial ligand. The anomalously slow His83 derivative of the Ru-myoglobin family is also dominated by an axial-ligand pathway. All "average" rates in cyt c and myoglobin (i.e., those rates that fit well by a single exponential decay law) access multiple-coupling pathways, including hemeedge-coupled pathways. As such, our distinction between multiple-pathway heme-edge-coupling routes and axial-ligand-dominated single-coupling routes rationalizes all of the anomalously slow ET rate data among 20 ground-state Ru-modified heme proteins (3, 17). Our heme-protein analysis indicates that exponential distance dependence for protein ET rates occurs in the small C multiple-pathway regime. Because small C values have been computed in nonheme proteins as well, we can further explore the correlation between small C values and exponential distance decay. Previous theoretical analysis of the blue-copper protein azurin indicates that all six Ru derivatives have very small C values (27), which is consistent with the measured single exponential decay of rates with distance in this protein for all derivatives (17). In azurin, the three strong coupling routes to the copper or the pathway cross-linking by hydrogen bonds provide likely physical sources of average-medium behavior. Although coherence parameter analysis remains to be performed for the Ru-modified high-potential iron protein (28), we expect that the anomalously slow Ru-His50 derivative will also have a large C associated with a weak dominant-coupling pathway. Rates in all 26 ruthenated myoglobin, cyt c, cyt b562, and azurin derivatives are explained within the dichotomy of an average-medium tunneling (small C) model or a single-pathway tunneling (large C) model. In Ru-modified heme proteins, heme-edge coupling produces average-medium behavior, whereas axial-ligand coupling generates pathway-specific D-A interactions. Tunneling-limited ET rates in the photosynthetic reaction center (PRC) follow an exponential distance-decay law (4). Preliminary analysis of coherence parameters in the PRC charge transfer reactions indicates values of 10-2 or less, which are consistent with multiple edge-coupled pathways and average-medium behavior. We find similar behavior in the DNA repair protein photolyase, where ET couples two delocalized pi-electron states (29). The accessibility of two coupling mechanisms seems essential for the analysis of evolutionary pressure on ET proteins. Earlier arguments regarding pathway evolution had been made along two lines. Simple (exponential) distance dependencies observed in the photosynthetic proteins led Moser, Dutton, and co-workers to suggest that evolution manipulates ET rates using RDA and Marcus (nuclear) parameters (4). Gray, Winkler, and co-workers, in contrast, argued that strong pathways have evolved to accelerate ET in some proteins (5). Indeed, the structure of common biological redox cofactors seems to permit ET proteins to access both mediation regimes. We suggest that, in the multiple-pathway regime, the evolutionary linkage between the specific protein fold and the ET rate is likely to be weak: In this regime, RDA determines tunneling propensity. In the single-pathway large C regime, however, ET kinetics and protein structure are strongly linked. Although the Ru proteins only display slow rates in the dominant pathway regime, either strong or weak coupling pathways could arise in the dominant pathway regime, generating order of magnitude effects on the ET kinetics from protein structure. This structure-function perspective extends the pathway-evolution conjecture of Ramirez et al. (5), by accounting for the influence of thermal motion on the protein-mediated coupling, and also suggests that the Moser-Dutton (average-medium) view is valid in the multiple-pathway regime common to many large edge-coupled redox cofactors. Tunneling routes involving axial ligands seem to be the most likely candidates for kinetics that is sensitive to coupling pathway structure [e.g., the heme a to heme a3 pathways in cyt c oxidase (5, 6)]. How often and where nature has used pathway-specific or multiple-pathway regimes remain to be determined by future analysis and experiments. Also, in the small C regime, proteins will have ET kinetics that are robust to modifications of single-pathway links (e.g., by manipulating hydrogen bonding), whereas pathway structural changes in the large C regime may have a larger influence on ET kinetics (30-32).
Abstract Posttranslational modifications of the histone octamer play important roles in regulating responses to DNA damage. Here, we reveal that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rtt109p promotes genome stability and resistance to DNA-damaging agents, and that it does this by functionally cooperating with the histone chaperone Asf1p to maintain normal chromatin structure. Furthermore, we show that, as for Asf1p, Rtt109p is required for histone H3 acetylation on lysine 56 (K56) in vivo. Moreover, we show that Rtt109p directly catalyzes this modification in vitro in a manner that is stimulated by Asf1p. These data establish Rtt109p as a member of a new class of histone acetyltransferases and show that its actions are critical for cell survival in the presence of DNA damage during S phase. Regulation of retrotransposition (RTT) by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ty1 transposon is intimately linked to the DNA-damage response (DDR), as many proteins are known to play roles in both pathways (1). We therefore reasoned that uncharacterized RTT genes might represent novel DDR factors. Although RTT109 has not been characterized in detail, it was previously linked to the DDR through genomewide studies systematically identifying mutants required for resistance to genotoxic agents (2, 3). To further characterize Rtt109p, we generated a deletion mutant (table S1) and examined its sensitivities to a wider range of DNA-damaging agents. We found that rtt109 mutants were hypersensitive to agents that generate replication stress (Fig. 1A, top). We also observed hypersensitivity of rtt109 cells to continuous growth on plates containing phleomycin, an ionizing radiation (IR) mimetic that induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, rtt109 cells were not markedly hypersensitive to acute IR treatment (Fig. 1A). Chronic DSB induction by phleomycin impinges on S-phase repair pathways, whereas most cells in an asynchronous culture, when subjected to acute IR treatment, arrest cell cycle progression and repair the DNA damage in G2 (4). Together, these results suggest a role for Rtt109p in DNA damage tolerance during S phase.

(B) The DNA content of asynchronous cultures of wild-type (WT) and rtt109 strains was determined by flow cytometric analysis. (C) Electrophoretic mobility of Rad53p was analyzed in extracts from asynchronous cultures of wild-type (WT), rtt109, and asf1 cells, and WT and rtt109 cells treated with phleomycin for 1 hour. (D) Cells displaying Rad52-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) foci as a function of cell cycle position determined by bud size; the mean and standard deviation of two independent experiments are shown. (E) GCR frequency was measured for the indicated strains (7); the mean and standard deviation of three fluctuation tests are shown. (F) Recombination frequencies were measured in the indicated strains with a direct repeat recombination assay (8); the mean and standard deviation of three fluctuation tests are shown. In addition to displaying DNA-damage hypersensitivity, we observed that rtt109 cells were slow growing. Flow cytometric analysis of an asynchronous rtt109 culture revealed a high proportion of cells in the G2-M stage of the cell cycle (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the DNA content profile for rtt109 cells was much broader than for the wild type, revealing that cell growth continued despite slowed cell cycle progression. Cells lacking both RTT109 and MEC1 (which encodes the central DNA-damage checkpoint kinase) had a budding index equivalent to that of the wild-type strain (fig. S1), which indicates that the altered cell cycle profile of rtt109 cells reflects activation of the DNA-damage check-point. This was confirmed by the presence of partially phosphorylated DDR effector kinase Rad53p in rtt109 cells, indicative of chronic checkpoint activation (Fig. 1C). Quantification of DSBs can be used to assess the presence of DNA damage in yeast cells (5, 6). Strikingly, we found that Rad52-YFP foci-markers of DSBs-occur at much higher frequencies in rtt109 cells than in wild-type cells (Fig. 1D). Very few foci were seen in wild-type cells and unbudded rtt109 cells, whereas they occurred in around 40% and 75% of small-budded and large-budded rtt109 cells, corresponding to S and G2 cells, respectively. These data therefore indicate increased spontaneously arising DNA damage in cells lacking Rtt109p, and suggest that such damage largely arises during S phase. To examine the effects of this DNA damage on genome stability, we measured rates of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) (7). Thus, we found that RTT109 deletion increased GCR rates about ninefold compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1E). As a further test for genome instability in rtt109 cells, we used a system to measure spontaneous recombination between tandem direct repeats (8). This revealed that RTT109 deletion yields a moderate hyperrecombination phenotype, similar to that exhibited by an sgs1 hyperrecombination mutant (Fig. 1F). These data indicate that rtt109 mutants display increased genomic instability, possibly as a consequence of spontaneously arising DNA damage and, furthermore, suggest that this reflects defects in responding to and/or repairing DNA damage arising during S phase. We noted that the phenotypes of rtt109 strains were similar to those reported for strains lacking the histone chaperone Asf1p (9, 10) and that large-scale genetic network analyses had revealed that the genetic interaction profile of RTT109 is highly similar to that of ASF1 (11, 12), which suggests they might act within the same pathway. Indeed, we found that the rtt109 asf1 double mutant was no more sensitive to hydroxyurea (HU) or methyl-methanesulfonate (MMS) than either single mutant (Fig. 2A). Although Asf1p stimulates histone deposition by the CAF-1 chromatin assembly complex in vitro (13), it also acts in a distinct and/or partially overlapping role in providing resistance to DNA-damaging agents (14). To address whether Rtt109p also acts synergistically with CAF-1, we combined the RTT109 deletion with a disruption of CAC1, which encodes a CAF-1 subunit. As for asf1 cac1 cells, rtt109 cac1 cells were more sensitive to HU or MMS than the single-mutant strains. Furthermore, rtt109 asf1 cac1 cells were no more sensitive than rtt109 cac1 cells (Fig. 2A). From these data, we conclude that Rtt109p acts in the same pathway as Asf1p in providing resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

Given the reported role of Asf1p in promoting nucleosome assembly (10, 13), we also analyzed the superhelical density of the 21/2 plasmid in rtt109 cells. RTT109 deletion caused a shift in the distribution of 21/2 topoisomers, which indicated increased supercoiling compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, a similar change in topoisomer distribution was caused by ASF1 deletion, and no further change was seen in an asf1 rtt109 double-mutant strain. These results therefore indicate that Rtt109p and Asf1p act together in governing chromatin structure. The DNA-damage hypersensitivity and slow growth of asf1 cells are associated with loss of acetylation on histone H3 lysine 56 (H3-K56) (15), but it has hitherto been unclear why K56 acetylation is absent in asf1 cells or which histone acetyltransferase (HAT) is responsible for acetylating this residue (16). Because of the epistatic relation between Asf1p and Rtt109p, we examined histone H3-K56 acetylation in rtt109 cells and found an absence of detectable K56 acetylation (Fig. 3A). Although either RTT109 deletion or mutation of histone H3-K56 to arginine resulted in hypersensitivity toward HU, the double mutant was no more sensitive than the single mutants (Fig. 3B). Growth curves also revealed an epistatic relation between the two mutants (fig. S2), which indicates that the growth defect of rtt109 cells is due to loss of H3-K56 acetylation.

(A) Western blot analysis of whole-cell extracts isolated from the indicated strains was performed with antibodies specific for histone H3 or histone H3 acetylated on K56 (H3-K56 Ac). (B) Serial dilutions (10-fold) of the indicated strains were plated on YPAD or YPAD containing HU. (C) Whole-cell extracts from the indicated strains were probed with antibodies for histone H3 and histone H3-K56 Ac. (D) Serial dilutions (10-fold) of the indicated strains were plated on YPAD at the indicated temperature. (E) (Right) A strain expressing a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged version of Rtt109p was arrested in G1 with -factor and released. Samples were taken at the indicated times for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). (Left) Western analysis was performed, probing for the indicated proteins with Pgk1p and histone H3 as loading controls and Clb2p as a G2-M marker. We reasoned that Rtt109p could either facilitate K56 acetylation or prevent K56 deacetylation by the known histone H3-K56 deacetylases Hst3p/Hst4p (17, 18). We found that, despite elevated K56 acetylation in the absence of Hst3p and Hst4p, K56 acetylation was undetectable in a hst3 hst4 rtt109 triple-mutant strain (Fig. 3C), which suggested that Rtt109p acts to promote H3-K56 acetylation. Consistent with these findings and as reported for ASF1 deletion (17), we observed that RTT109 deletion suppressed the temperature-sensitive growth defect of a hst3 hst4 strain (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, because H3-K56 acetylation shows cell cycle control (19), we examined Rtt109p expression during cell cycle progression. Thus, we found that Rtt109p levels peak just before maximal K56 acetylation (Fig. 3E), as would be expected if Rtt109p is required for generating this modification. To examine whether and how Rtt109p might mediate H3-K56 acetylation, we expressed and purified recombinant Rtt109p and Asf1p. Histone acetylation assays revealed that, although histone H3 acetylation took place with Rtt109p alone, this activity was enhanced in the presence of Asf1p (Fig. 4A). Autoradiographic analysis of the reactions also revealed that Rtt109p auto-acetylates and weakly acetylates Asf1p, but not bovine serum albumin (Fig. 4B). Moreover, Western immunoblots of acetylation reactions probed with an antibody directed against acetylated H3-K56 revealed that Asf1p markedly stimulates the ability of Rtt109p to acetylate this site (Fig. 4C). This finding indicates that Asf1p governs the substrate specificity of Rtt109p. Because we have been unable to obtain evidence for a physical interaction between Asf1p and Rtt109p, we currently favor a model whereby an Asf1p-H3/H4 complex provides the optimal substrate for H3 acetylation by Rtt109p.

Asterisks mark a degradation product of Asf1p. (C) Alternatively, a nitrocellulose membrane corresponding to the first five lanes of (B) was probed with an antibody against H3-K56 Ac. Taken together, our findings reveal that S. cerevisiae Rtt109p is the predominant HAT for histone H3-K56 in vivo and that this acetylation plays a critical role or roles in conferring resistance to spontaneously arising or experimentally induced DNA damage or replication stress. Notably, although the putative acetyl-CoA-binding sites of various previously known acetyltransferases display some sequence homologies with one another (20), we have not found significant homologies between these and Rtt109p. This raises the possibility that Rtt109p evolved catalytic activity independently of other known HATs and highlights the prospect of there being further as-yet-uncharacterized acetyltransferases that have not come to light through sequence analyses. Finally, our findings provide a mechanism for how Asf1 promotes histone H3 acetylation and thereby influences chromatin structure and genome stability.
Abstract Predictions of ecological response to climate change are based largely on direct climatic effects on species. We show that, in a California grassland, species interactions strongly influence responses to changing climate, overturning direct climatic effects within 5 years. We manipulated the seasonality and intensity of rainfall over large, replicate plots in accordance with projections of leading climate models and examined responses across several trophic levels. Changes in seasonal water availability had pronounced effects on individual species, but as precipitation regimes were sustained across years, feedbacks and species interactions overrode autecological responses to water and reversed community trajectories. Conditions that sharply increased production and diversity through 2 years caused simplification of the food web and deep reductions in consumer abundance after 5 years. Changes in these natural grassland communities suggest a prominent role for species interactions in ecosystem response to climate change. Impacts of recent climate change on plants and animals are already evident, as geographic distributions shift poleward (1, 2) and toward higher elevations (3, 4), phenological events advance in time (5-7), and some species disappear altogether (8). With further climate change still expected, prediction of future impacts has become critical to conservation planning and management. To forecast ecological change under continued climate warming, however, we need a better understanding of the relative importance of direct responses by individual species to climate versus responses mediated by changing interactions with resources, competitors, pathogens, or consumers (9-14). We imposed projected future precipitation regimes over grassland in northern California to evaluate the importance to ecosystem response of direct effects on grassland species versus indirect effects arising from species interactions. Much of the California coastal region experiences a Mediterranean climate, characterized by wet winters and long summer droughts. Ecological responses to climate change in regions with Mediterranean climate regimes may be strongly driven by the redistribution of water in time and space (15). Changes in seasonal water availability that affect plant phenology, for example, could lead to temporal mismatch between resource availability and consumer demand (16), which can have important effects on resource flow and ecosystem function (17). General circulation models developed at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research (HadCM2) and the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CCM1) (18) predict substantial increases in precipitation over most of California but differ in the projected seasonality of these increases. The Hadley model calls for all additional rain to fall during the current winter rainy season, whereas the Canadian model projects increased rainfall extending into the current summer drought. The discrepancy between the two scenarios may be critical to the fate of grassland ecosystems in California, where summer drought severely constrains plant growth and the timing of rainfall is more important to annual production and species composition than the amount (19-22). In 2001, we began a large-scale rainfall manipulation in a northern California grassland to examine the consequences of these two projected regimes for production and diversity of grassland plants and invertebrates. In a grassland at the Angelo Coast Range Reserve in Mendocino County, California (39 44' 17.7" N, 123 37' 48.4" W), 18 circular 70-m2 plots were subjected to one of three watering treatments: a winter addition of water (January through March), a spring addition of water (April through June), and an unmanipulated ambient control (Fig. 1). Each watered plot received about 44 cm of supplementary water over ambient rainfall per year, roughly a 20% increase over mean annual precipitation but within natural variability in both amount and timing at the study site (fig. S1). We examined treatment effects on plant production and species composition over 5 consecutive years and quantified responses of invertebrate herbivores and their natural enemies over 3 years (23).

Detailed methods are available online (23). Effects of increased rainfall depended critically on the seasonality of the increase. Supplemental water addition during the wet winter period produced moderate increases in plant production in some years of the study (Fig. 2), but effects did not extend to higher trophic levels (Figs. 3 and 4). In general, communities in winter-addition and ambient rainfall plots responded similarly across years to annual variation in rainfall.

Gray shading highlights responses in the final year of the study, when late natural rainfall mirrored the spring-addition watering treatment. Extending the rainy season via spring water addition produced much more dramatic changes in the grassland community. Plant production more than tripled in the first year and more than doubled in the second compared with the control (Fig. 2A). The strongest initial response was by nitrogen-fixing forbs, whose production increased by nearly two orders of magnitude with extended spring rainfall (Fig. 2B). Exotic annual grasses showed a weaker response to the first year of spring water addition, but after the proliferation of nitrogen-fixing forbs that year, annual grass production rose dramatically (Fig. 2C). These grasses, so-called winter annuals because they are the first plants to germinate each year and are among the earliest to complete their life cycle and senesce, generally do not respond to extensions of the rainy season beyond April (22, 24). Early phenology thus limited the direct response of annual grasses to extended rainfall but allowed these plants to benefit in the subsequent growing season from a fertilization effect after decomposition of abundant N-fixer litter (25-27). As this process was repeated year after year, the accumulation of annual grass litter suppressed germination and regrowth of leafy forbs (Fig. 2D), as has often been seen in California annual grasslands (26, 28-30), and drove steep declines in plant species richness (Fig. 3A). Shifts in plant composition in spring-addition plots had important consequences for biodiversity and food web structure. Initially, extended rainfall promoted increased plant species richness (Fig. 3A), and this increase, coupled with greater primary production and water availability, supported greater diversity and abundance of invertebrate herbivores, predators, and parasitoids (Figs. 3B and 4). As forbs were eliminated from spring-addition plots by annual grasses, however, plant species richness collapsed to nearly half that in control plots. With early-senescing annual grasses increasingly dominating the resource base, food availability and habitat quality for higher trophic levels diminished. This was especially true during summer, when late-blooming forbs provide a critical food resource for invertebrate herbivores (fig. S2). In contrast, annual grass litter has low nutritional value, and monocultures of these plants offer less structural complexity than mixed grassforb assemblages. By the fifth year of the study, when heavy rains continued into summer in a naturally extended rainy season throughout northern California, spring-addition plots stood out as islands of low biodiversity and reduced consumer abundances (Fig. 3B and 4). In addition to the nearly 50% reduction in plant species richness in spring-addition relative to control plots, invertebrate richness was 20% lower, and herbivore and predator abundances were each nearly 50% lower than ambient values measured in control plots. This simplification of the grassland community did not result from climatic conditions that were inherently unfavorable to production and diversity. Species at every trophic level benefited strongly from experimental extension of the rainy season in spring-addition plots early in the study, just as they did from a natural extension of the rainy season in winter-addition and control plots late in the study. But as altered environmental conditions persisted across years, individualistic responses by species to climate were overshadowed by the lagged effects of altered community-level interactions. The congruence between initial responses to artificial extension in spring-addition plots and responses in the grassland as a whole to naturally late rain-fall in year 5 provides compelling evidence that these mechanisms are real rather than experimental artifacts. Uncertainty remains in the projections of global climate models; indeed, the next-generation Hadley model (HadCM3) forecasts decreased rainfall over much of California (31). Yet under any scenario of future climate change, prediction of ecological effects will require understanding the web of interactions that mediate species-through ecosystem-level responses (14). To date, forecasts of range shifts and extinction probabilities are based largely on species-climate envelope models (32-34). These models are powerful initial tools with which to explore consequences of alternative climate scenarios, but they cannot forecast lagged impacts of altered higher-order interactions that will govern the trajectories of ecosystems under sustained climatic change. Nonlinearities are expected from the assembly of new combinations of species brought together by climate-induced range shifts, but these can also arise from environmental effects on the strength and direction of interspecific interactions without any change in species composition (35, 36). The nature and scales of these effects are best revealed by long-term experiments in natural field settings that improve understanding of how climate change impacts propagate through ecological communities. Indirect effects of climate on species will commonly lag behind direct effects, but their importance makes system-level interactions crucial to climate change forecasting even at subdecadal time scales.
Abstract Wilms tumor is a pediatric kidney cancer associated with inactivation of the WT1 tumor-suppressor gene in 5 to 10% of cases. Using a high-resolution screen for DNA copy-number alterations in Wilms tumor, we identified somatic deletions targeting a previously uncharacterized gene on the X chromosome. This gene, which we call WTX, is inactivated in approximately one-third of Wilms tumors (15 of 51 tumors). Tumors with mutations in WTX lack WT1 mutations, and both genes share a restricted temporal and spatial expression pattern in normal renal precursors. In contrast to biallelic inactivation of autosomal tumor-suppressor genes, WTX is inactivated by a monoallelic "single-hit" event targeting the single X chromosome in tumors from males and the active X chromosome in tumors from females. Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma) is the most common pediatric kidney cancer and is derived from pluripotent renal precursors that produce undifferentiated blastemal cells, primitive epithelial structures, and stromal components [reviewed in (1)]. In 1972, Knudson and Strong proposed that Wilms tumor, like retinoblastoma, may develop as a consequence of two independent rate-limiting genetic events, subsequently defined as biallelic inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene (1). This prediction was borne out by the identification of WT1, a zinc finger transcription factor gene on chromosome 11p13 that is targeted by germline heterozygous deletions in the WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation), by germline point mutations in the Denys-Drash syndrome (Wilms tumor, pseudohermaphroditism, and nephropathy), and by somatic biallelic inactivation in 5 to 10% of sporadic Wilms tumors (2-4). Although inactivation of WT1 affects only a small subset of cases, this gene has been shown to encode a master regulator of kidney development, which appears to be required for the survival and subsequent differentiation of renal stem cells (5, 6). Other known abnormalities in Wilms tumor include activating mutations in the -catenin gene (CTNNB1) on chromosome 3p22, which often coincide with WT1 mutations (7), and epigenetic dysregulation of IGF2 and H19 (8) at the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome locus on chromosome 11p15. In the majority of cases, however, no specific genetic abnormalities have been identified. To search for genetic abnormalities in sporadic Wilms tumor, we performed a detailed genome-wide scan (70-kb median resolution) for DNA copy-number changes in 51 primary tumor specimens using long-oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) (9). In marked contrast to most adult epithelial cancers, the baseline CGH profile in Wilms tumor was quite stable, with an average of only 3.1 large (more than 5 mb) DNA copy-number changes per tumor after accounting for known copy-number polymorphisms (10, 11). As expected, we detected single-copy losses in a subset of cases, including known loci of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosomes 1p (18%), 16q (14%), 11p (6%), and 7p (4%) (4, 12). LOH at chromosome 11p15 is commonly associated with gene conversion rather than single-copy loss and is therefore underrepresented in our array CGH analysis (13). Notably, we detected small overlapping deletions at chromosome locus Xq11.1 in tumors from 5 out of 26 male patients. The deletions involved only one to three probes in each case, with a minimal area of overlap implicating a single previously uncharacterized gene (FAM123B/FLJ39827) that we named WTX, for "Wilms Tumor gene on the X chromosome" (Fig. 1, A and B). Alldeletions were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of genomic DNA, including two cases with deletion breakpoints internal to WTX (Fig. 1C). Genomic deletions were also analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (representative example in Fig. 1D). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

The endogenous WTX transcript differed from that predicted by database annotation in the 3' end and required assembly with the use of rapid amplification of cDNA ends and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR from human and mouse cDNA (fig.

The full-length transcript (7.5 kb) encodes a protein of 1135 amino acids, containing a nuclear localization signal, two coiled-coil domains, an acidic domain that overlaps the first coiled coil, and a proline-rich domain (Fig. 2A). WTX orthologs are present in vertebrates, including zebrafish, but do not share substantial homology with other genes of known function (fig. S2).

Probes for the X centromere (blue), WTX (red), and Xist (green) were used. Only one copy of WTX is present, associated with the inactive (Xist positive) X chromosome (Xi). The active X chromosome (Xa) is marked by the X centromere probe but lacks both WTX and Xist. The same pattern was observed in all tumor cells, consistent with tumor clonality. Scale bar, 5 1/2m. (D) Sequence tracings of genomic DNA and cDNA from a female Wilms tumor case with a heterozygous WTX mutation. Both alleles are detectable in genomic DNA but only the mutant allele is present in cDNA, indicating that only the mutant WTX allele is transcribed. (E) Schematic representation of Wilms tumor cases with mutations in WTX (red), WT1 (yellow), or -catenin (blue). Although WT1 and -catenin mutations can be present in the same tumor, there is no overlap between mutations in WTX and mutations in these two genes. WTX mutations are listed in table S1. WT1 and -catenin mutations are listed in table S2. Tumors 1 through 51 (underlined) were tested for both deletions and point mutations in WTX. The remaining tumors were tested for point mutations only. To search for intragenic point mutations, we sequenced the entire coding region of WTX in 82 Wilms tumor specimens, including the 51 cases previously analyzed by array CGH. Intragenic truncating mutations were identified in six tumors, including one nonsense mutation (Arg358Ter, where Ter is the termination of the chain) observed in two independent cases (table S1). All predicted protein truncations were N terminal to the second coiled-coil domain encoded by WTX (Fig. 2A). A seventh case harbored a missense mutation (Lys292Asn292) affecting an evolutionarily conserved residue. Consistent with somatic events, WTX mutations were absent in matched normal tissue in all four cases where such tissue was available (Fig. 2B) (table S1). Mutations identified in cases without matched normal tissue were not detected in control DNA from 269 healthy individuals. In contrast to the classical biallelic "two-hit" Knudson model, the identification of somatic mutations affecting an X chromosome gene in sporadic Wilms tumor raises the possibility of "one-hit" inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene. This applies to the hemizygous deletions and point mutations detected in males and, given that WTX is located in a chromosomal region subject to X inactivation (14), it would also apply to the heterozygous mutations detected in females if the active copy of the X chromosome is selectively targeted. To test this hypothesis, we used FISH analysis to search for heterozygous WTX deletions in female cases and to determine whether they affected the active or inactive X chromosome. Heterozygous WTX deletions in female cases were more reliably identified by FISH, compared with the initial array CGH analysis, presumably because of high signal-to-noise ratios for single-copy changes involving a small number of probes. Indeed, among 25 female Wilms tumor cases analyzed, 6 showed deletion of one WTX allele, as assessed by FISH with a probe for WTX and control probes for the X chromosome centromere and a telomeric Xq locus (table S1) (fig. S3). To determine whether these deletions targeted the active X chromosome allele, we performed simultaneous FISH analysis for WTX, the X chromosome centromere, and the inactive X chromosome coating transcript Xist (15). In all four cases tested, the intact WTX gene was present in the inactive X chromosome coated by Xist, whereas no WTX signal was detected in the active X chromosome that lacked Xist hybridization (Fig. 2C). Heterozygous WTX deletions in female Wilms tumors therefore target the active X chromosome, leading to gene inactivation by a single event. We extended this analysis to an intragenic mutation of WTX (Glu334Ter) in a female Wilms tumor in which it was possible to compare the nucleotide sequence of PCR products generated from genomic DNA or cDNA. Indeed, although the mutation was heterozygous in genomic DNA, only the mutant sequence was detected in the tumor-derived transcripts, consistent with monoallelic expression of the mutant copy from the active X chromosome (Fig. 2D). Taken together with the FISH analysis, these data indicate that intragenic mutations and gross chromosomal deletions of WTX occur at comparable frequencies in male and female Wilms tumor cases and that in females they exclusively target the active X chromosome. Overall, of 51 tumors tested for both gene-copy alterations and intragenic mutations, 11 (21.6%) had WTX deletions, and 4 (7.8%) had point mutations (total 15 out of 51, 29.4%) (table S1). In these tumors, WT1 mutations were detected in three cases (5.9%) and -catenin mutations in four cases (7.8%). As expected (7), there was overlap between WT1 and -catenin mutations (two out of three cases with WT1 mutations). In contrast, no tumor with a deletion or point mutation in WTX contained mutations in WT1 or -catenin (Fig. 2E). Whether inactivation of WTX defines a distinct subset of nephroblastomas remains to be investigated. In contrast to other tumor-suppressor genes, WT1 has a developmentally regulated pattern of expression in the organ in which the tumor arises. The restricted expression of WT1 in renal blastemal stem cells and glomerular podocyte precursors is consistent with the presumed cell type of origin of Wilms tumor and highlights the key physiological role of WT1 in normal kidney development (16). In the mouse, WTX expression is relatively high in the neonatal brain and kidney and then declines substantially in the mature organs (Fig. 3A). Lung and spleen also express WTX, but with a less notable developmental profile. The temporal patterns of WTX and WT1 expression within the kidney are virtually identical, consistent with a wave of differentiation that is ongoing at the time of birth and is completed by postnatal week 3 (Fig. 3B). As assessed by RNA in situ hybridization, WT1 and WTX display a high, but not complete, degree of overlap in expression in the kidney. Similar to WT1, WTX is expressed in the condensing metanephric mesenchyme and in early epithelial structures that are precursors to glomeruli (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, both genes are present in the pluripotent cells that are the presumed precursors of Wilms tumor. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3. Regulated expression of WTX.

(E) Suppression of colony formation after ectopic expression of WTX in HEK-293 cells and U2OS cells. Cells were cotransfected with a WTX expression plasmid (or empty vector) and a plasmid encoding a drug-resistance marker (puromycin). Experiments were performed in triplicate and drug-resistant colonies were stained after 2 weeks. Representative plates and mean colony numbers are shown ( standard error of the mean). Functional studies of WT1 and other genes implicated in Wilms tumorigenesis have been hampered by the absence of either mouse tumor models or experimentally manipulable Wilms tumor cell lines. Thus, we ectopically expressed WTX in cancer cell lines that have been used to model WT1 function. In human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells, transfection of WTX ledtoa marked suppression of colony formation (Fig. 3E). Apoptosis was evident in HEK-293 cells 48 hours after ectopic expression of WTX (fig. S4). Studies in such heterologous cell types point to functional properties consistent with a tumor suppressor, but a more complete understanding of protein function will require in vivo studies of this developmentally regulated gene in the appropriate cellular context (5, 6). Our data suggest that WTX is a Wilms tumor-suppressor gene with a potentially important role in normal kidney development. In addition, the localization of WTX on the X chromosome allows for complete inactivation by one mutational event targeting the single X allele in males or the active X allele in females. X-linked familial syndromes with increased cancer risk (17-19) preferentially affect males. In contrast, WTX is frequently altered in sporadic tumors by a single somatic event that affects both sexes equally. One-hit inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene on the X chromosome is a departure from the traditional biallelic Knudson model and has been postulated but never documented (20, 21). Although single-hit gene inactivation in Wilms tumor could lead to greatly increased tumorigenesis, its restriction to a limited pool of pluripotent target cells within a specific developmental window would mitigate this effect. As for WTX, high-resolution copy-number analysis and direct sequencing may be required for the identification of other X chromosome tumor suppressors subject to monoallelic inactivation, given that they are not marked by the characteristic secondary allelic loss (LOH) traditionally used for mapping. Together with recently described X chromosome abnormalities in a subset of breast cancer (22), the frequency of single-hit gene inactivation exemplified by WTX suggests that X chromosome genes may play unappreciated roles in human cancer.
Abstract Near-shore waters along the northwest African margin are characterized by coastal upwelling and represent one of the world's major upwelling regions. Sea surface temperature (SST) records from Moroccan sediment cores, extending back 2500 years, reveal anomalous and unprecedented cooling during the 20th century, which is consistent with increased upwelling. Upwelling-driven SSTs also vary out of phase with millennial-scale changes in Northern Hemisphere temperature anomalies (NHTAs) and show relatively warm conditions during the Little Ice Age and relatively cool conditions during the Medieval Warm Period. Together, these results suggest that coastal upwelling varies with NHTAs and that upwelling off northwest Africa may continue to intensify as global warming and atmospheric CO2 levels increase. Coastal upwelling occurs along the eastern margins of major ocean basins and develops when predominantly alongshore winds force offshore Ekman transport of surface waters, which leads to the ascending (or upwelling) of cooler, nutrient-rich water (1). Coastal upwelling is of large economic importance and accounts for 1/220% of the global fish catch, yet constitutes 50.7'N, 1005.9'W; 355-m water depth) (Fig. 1). The region off Cape Ghir is particularly well suited for the study of upwelling because it constitutes one of the most persistent upwelling cells along the NW African coast, with upwelling occurring year-round (8-10). Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in upwelling zones are sensitive indicators of changes in upwelling intensity and prevailing winds (8, 11), and, in the Cape Ghir area, cooler SSTs result directly from increased upwelling intensity (8, 10) (Fig. 1). Thus, using the well-established alkenone unsaturation index () as a SST proxy, we reconstructed SST and upwelling at Cape Ghir (12). We have confidence in the use of alkenone as an SST proxy at Cape Ghir because several factors that could have a potentially detrimental influence on the -SST relationship are minimized at this site [see supporting online material (SOM) text]. We also measured the carbon isotope ratio (13C) of the benthic foraminifera Uvigerina mediterranea in both cores (12) to obtain a record of anthropogenic carbon input into the ocean as recorded at site GeoB6008.

The SST data show a narrow strip of cold coastal waters (purple and dark blue), 3 to 5C colder than open ocean SSTs, indicating the Cape Ghir upwelling center. A coastal upwelling filament (light blue) is also present, extending offshore from Cape Ghir. When taken together, dating of the sediment cores shows that they extend from 520 B.C. to 1998 A.D. (12). 210Pb dating on the 33-cm-long multi-core and the upper 17 cm of the gravity core (Fig. 2 and fig. S1), in addition to eight calibrated accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon analyses on the rest of the gravity core (Fig. 3A and table S1), reveals an extremely high sedimentation rate of 1/2210 cm per thousand years (12). This finding, along with a sampling resolution of between 2 and 25 years, allows an unprecedented view of 20th-century and late-Holocene upwelling history.

For most of the 20th century, the two alkenone SST reconstructions show a steady cooling trend of 1/21.2C, which indicates an increase in upwelling intensity (Fig. 2). In addition, the patterns of variability during the 1/260-year period where the two cores overlap (1912 to 1971 A.D.) are notably similar, which attests to the consistency of the age model in this part of the core and of the SST signal in each record. The trend to cooler SSTs and increased upwelling through the 20th century is consistent with pronounced upwelling intensification for the latter part of the 20th century inferred from two calculated upwelling indices for the Canary Current region (3, 13). Our SST changes are also consistent with increased, upwelling-favorable meridional wind speed observations for Cape Ghir (Fig. 2) and for the grid squares to the immediate north and south of the cape along the Moroccan coast (not shown) (14). Direct comparison of the alkenone SSTs with instrumental SST records is difficult because ships of opportunity (i.e., commercial vessels that have agreed to collect oceanographic data en route to their destination) in this region pass too far from the coast to detect the upwelling (8, 11), and gridded data sets smooth out the cooler upwelled-water SST signal. The absolute alkenone SST values are, however, within the range of SSTs reported by research cruises in the Cape Ghir region (SOM text). In addition, the trend to cooler SSTs at Cape Ghir is consistent with a trend to cooler SSTs for 1982 to 2001 A.D. based on satellite-derived observations for coastal upwelling along the Iberian margin (37 to 42N) and the NW African margin (22 to 30N and 12 to 20N) (15). When viewed in the context of the SST anomaly reconstruction from the entire gravity core for the past 2500 years (Fig. 3B), the final 100 years of the record clearly show the strongest decrease in SST (corresponding to an increase in upwelling), which is larger and more rapid than any other change in the record. The period from 1965 to 1998 A.D. is particularly cold and is 1/20.5C colder than the next coolest 35-year period (1845 to 1880 A.D.) [mean SST anomaly from 1965 to 1998 A.D. = -0.52 0.05C (SEM), n = 15, where n is the number of alkenone SST anomaly values for the given period; mean SST anomaly from 1845 to 1880 C.E. = -0.06 0.05C (SEM), n =7]. The GeoB6008-1 alkenone SST record also shows pronounced millennial-scale variability during the past 2500 years (Fig. 3B). This variability is highlighted through reconstruction of the long-term mode, based on the 2nd and 3rd quasi-periodic components identified through singular spectrum analysis of the GeoB6008-1 SST record (12) (table S2). The reconstructed millennial mode for GeoB6008-1 shows local SST maxima at 1/2600 and 1600 A.D. and SST minima at 1/20 B.C./A.D. and 1150 A.D. (Fig. 3B). All of these extremes correspond to inferred periods of warming and cooling in the Northern Hemisphere, the most recent of which being the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA) (16) (Fig. 3B). The 13C record of the benthic foraminifer U. mediterranea (Fig. 3B) supports the age model of our core and also suggests the presence of anthropogenic CO2 for the most recent part of the record (SOM text). Carbon isotope values substantially decrease with respect to the past 2500 years at the beginning of the 20th century. This decrease reflects the so-called "oceanic Suess effect": the oceanic uptake of isotopically light CO2 released by the burning of fossil fuels (17) (Fig. 3C). Recent estimates of the magnitude of the oceanic Suess effect are between 0.7 and 0.9 per mil () up to the early 1990s, for both tropical Atlantic and Arctic Ocean surface waters (18, 19). This range is consistent with the observed 20th-century decrease of 1/20.8 in the carbon isotopic composition of U. mediterranea. The presence of an anthropogenic signal in the 13C record confirms that the upper part of the cores spans the 20th century, as suggested by the 210Pb-dating results. Furthermore, the strong covariance between 13C and alkenone SST records for the 20th century suggests an influence of global warming on the temperature evolution and upwelling intensity at site GeoB6008. The rapid 20th-century cooling at Cape Ghir also coincides with the rise in atmospheric CO2 (Fig. 3C) and likely reflects the influence of CO2 on the land-sea thermal contrast in NW Africa and, in turn, on the alongshore winds driving the upwelling. According to the mechanism proposed by Bakun (3), increased atmospheric CO2 concentration could lead to warmer surface air temperatures (SATs) over land relative to those over the ocean, particularly at nighttime when radiative cooling is suppressed by the blocking of outgoing longwave radiation by CO2. The increased SAT deepens the thermal low-pressure cell over land while a higher-pressure center develops over the slower-warming ocean waters. The winds blow clockwise around the high and anticlockwise around the continental low. The coast represents the boundary separating the two centers. Therefore, along the coast, the wind is oriented alongshore and southward (equatorward), which thus drives the upwelling and negative SST anomalies. The proposed mechanism is feasible to explain the increase in upwelling off Cape Ghir. At seasonal-to-interannual time scales, the pressure gradient between the coastal Atlantic and NW African continental interior was found to correlate with cooler NW African coastal SSTs and increased upwelling (9). At decadal time scales, analysis of global mean SAT records from 1950 to 1993 A.D. shows an increase in minimum air temperatures and a decrease in the diurnal temperature range over northern Africa (20), which would facilitate an increase in the land-sea pressure gradient. In addition, during the late 20th century, warmer SATs over the Saharan landmass and Eurasian continent were found to correlate with lower mean sea-level pressure over the Saharan landmass (the Sahara Low) (21). The Sahara Low is expected to further deepen with increased CO2 (21). Deepening of the Sahara Low could enhance the land-sea pressure difference, leading to further intensification of upwelling. Site GeoB6008 could also be influenced by the Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO) (22) through its impact on the Azores High. However, the strong trend to cooler Cape Ghir SSTs and the overall weak-to-nonexistent trend in the AO/NAO for much of the 20th century (23) would suggest that the AO/NAO is not the dominant factor that influences the upwelling. The normalized Cape Ghir SST anomaly record, which includes the rapid temperature changes of the past century and the millennial-scale variability, covaries with Northern Hemisphere temperature anomaly (NHTA) reconstructions (24-26), though with the opposite sign, showing a reverse "hockey stick" pattern (Fig. 3, B and C, and table S2). For example, from 1450 to 1850 A.D. (i.e., the extent of the LIA), relative warmth is observed in the GeoB6008 SST record when compared with relative cooling in the NHTA records. The antiphased behavior is an unexpected result, given the large regional variability captured from different locations by the proxy records used in the NHTA reconstructions as compared to the variability of alkenone SST record, which is a point-recorded time series. The link, however, between NHTA reconstructions and upwelling could come through the land-sea thermal contrast proposed above. The millennial-scale, hemispheric temperature variations could manifest as a greater change in land SAT as compared to SATs over the ocean, which may affect landsea pressure gradients, alongshore winds, and therefore upwelling. Upwelling processes, in general, may be sensitive to increased levels of CO2. Our results of intensified 20th-century upwelling off the NW African coast also indicate a sensitivity of upwelling to SAT. Other recent findings show increased 20th-century Arabian Sea upwelling, which is attributed to global warming-related heating of the Eurasian landmass (5, 7). There is also evidence for increased upwelling along the Iberian margin (3, 15) and parts of the California Current and Peru-Chile Current systems (3, 27) as a result of higher CO2 levels (3). Given the apparent overall sensitivity of upwelling during the 20th century to increases in CO2 and our paleo-results of a distinct upwelling response to hemispheric-scale warming and cooling, these results strongly imply that upwelling may continue to intensify with future increased levels of atmospheric CO2 and global warming. Upwelling regions, including Cape Ghir, show extremely high levels of biological activity, yet the ecosystem response to upwelling in these regions is dependant on a complex balance of temperature, ocean chemistry, ocean circulation, and fishing pressure (6). Given the importance of these marine ecosystems, our dependence on these highly valuable fisheries, and the potential role of upwelling in the drawdown of atmospheric CO2, further understanding of climate feedbacks in upwelling regions and the ecological and socioeconomic repercussions is an imperative.
Abstract Since the mid-1980s, our understanding of nutrient limitation of oceanic primary production has radically changed. Mesoscale iron addition experiments (FeAXs) have unequivocally shown that iron supply limits production in one-third of the world ocean, where surface macronutrient concentrations are perennially high. The findings of these 12 FeAXs also reveal that iron supply exerts controls on the dynamics of plankton blooms, which in turn affect the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, silicon, and sulfur and ultimately influence the Earth climate system. However, extrapolation of the key results of FeAXs to regional and seasonal scales in some cases is limited because of differing modes of iron supply in FeAXs and in the modern and paleo-oceans. New research directions include quantification of the coupling of oceanic iron and carbon biogeochemistry. The work of John Martin (1, 2) sharply focused attention on the role of iron (Fe) in ocean productivity, biogeochemical cycles, and global climate by proposing "that phytoplankton growth in major nutrient-rich waters is limited by iron deficiency" (2). The candidate mechanism of Martin (1, 2) points to the importance of changes, over geological time, in the magnitude of macronutrient uptake by phytoplankton in waters where macronutrient concentrations are perennially high (1). Specifically, Fe supply to the ocean was much higher during glacial maxima than at present (1), and it is estimated that the increase in Fe-induced productivity could have contributed perhaps 30% of the 80-ppm drawdown in atmospheric CO2 observed during glacial maxima by enhancing the ocean's biological pump (3). Early results from shipboard incubations in high nutrient-low chlorophyll (HNLC) waters presented compelling but equivocal evidence that phytoplankton growth was limited by Fe availability (2). After rigorous discussion, a consensus was reached (4) that, because shipboard experiments have artifacts, mesoscale Fe addition experiments (FeAXs) offered the best approach to resolve questions about the role of Fe in ocean productivity, C cycling, and climate. The main objective of FeAXs was to test whether Fe enrichment would increase primary productivity in HNLC waters, but additional questions focused on how Fe enrichment would affect nutrient use and export (1). The era of mesoscale Fe enrichments started with IronEx I, where Fe and the conservative tracer SF6 (5) were added to tropical HNLC surface waters (6). A further 11 FeAXs of similar design (7, 8) in different HNLC regions (Fig. 1) later confirmed the capability to study pelagic ecology and biogeochemical cycling in a discrete water parcel over time and space scales of weeks and kilometers. Complementary approaches include ship-based observations of persistent blooms within HNLC waters (Fig. 1), termed here FeNXs (Fe natural enrichment experiments), that are driven by sustained and localized Fe enrichment (9).

For the geographical positions of the FeAXs, see (8). FeeP investigated whether N-fixing phytoplankton are simultaneously limited by Fe and P; see Table 1. Common Findings in FeAXs FeAXs have each used a common framework (7) that enables comparison of their biogeochemical signatures (Table 1 and tables S1 to S3). The results of FeAXs have substantially increased our understanding of ecological and biogeochemical dynamics and their interrelationships, and many findings are consistent with theory-based predictions of ecosystem dynamics. For example, they have shown that phytoplankton grow faster in warmer open-ocean waters (table S2), as predicted by algal physiological relationships (10), and that blooms across a range of FeAX sites display an inverse relationship between chlorophyll concentration and mixed-layer depth (Table 1), as forecast by theoretical relationships between light penetration and mixed-layer depth (8, 11, 12). More specifically, FeAXs have verified that Fe enrichment enhances primary production from polar to tropical HNLC waters (Table 1) and confirmed that Fe supply has a fundamental role in photosynthesis (photosynthetic competence, table S1), diatom sinking, Fe uptake rates (13), and other physiological processes. FeAXs have demonstrated reduced silica requirements of diatoms when relieved of Fe stress (14), confirming results from bottle experiments (15). Table 1. The main findings from the 12 FeAXs (in chronological order from left to right) conducted between 1993 and 2005 [for additional details, see (8)]. See tables S1 to S3 for further details of initial conditions, ecosystem structure, and biogeochemical responses. Light climate, defined as the mean irradiance available to phytoplankton in the mixed layer, was calculated according to I = I0[1 - exp(-Kez)]/Kez, where I is mean mixed-layer irradiance (PAR), I0 is the subsurface PAR, Ke is the vertical light attenuation coefficient (m-1), and z is the depth of the upper mixed layer. Dilution rate is the mean growth rate of the SF6-labeled patch over the duration of each FeAX. Each property is expressed volumetrically but can readily be converted to a column integral by using the data on mixed-layer depth (MLD). Terms prefixed with a delta such as DIC denote maximum minus initial concentrations; nc, no significant change (relative to the surrounding HNLC waters); blank cells indicate that no data are currently available. The ratio of maximum to minimum primary production is based on column integrals.

View inline Increased export was mainly associated with a subduction event. These mesoscale experiments have provided detailed time-series observations, within a tracer-labeled parcel of water [i.e., a Lagrangian framework (7)], of open-ocean blooms from initiation through evolution and decline (Table 1). Data collection within a Lagrangian framework gives unparalleled insights into bloom dynamics and clarifies how the interplay of factors such as initial conditions (table S1) and loss processes defines properties such as bloom magnitude, which exhibits a factor of 10 range in chlorophyll concentrations between FeAXs (Table 1). The broad suite of measurements and their high temporal resolution in FeAXs will be a useful tool to better interpret the less highly resolved observations available for naturally occurring blooms [e.g., the Antarctic Environment and Southern Ocean Process Study (AESOPS) (16)]. Furthermore, the high-resolution data sets have enabled the establishment of a mechanistic understanding, in some FeAXs, of the evolution, termination, and decline phases of blooms (17) (Table 1). The durations of these bloom phases provide an estimate of the lag time between the accumulation of phytoplankton C and its subsequent export (17); such an estimate has proved elusive in previous studies (18). This experimental approach has presented a platform to examine in detail the interactions of top-down and bottom-up control-outlined in the ecumenical Fe hypothesis (19)-on phytoplankton community structure. For example, stocks of all phytoplankton groups increased initially upon Fe enrichment, but only the diatoms bloomed (Table 1) by escaping grazing pressure. Thus, unlike bottle incubations, FeAXs offer a holistic approach to studying the entire pelagic food web. This enables assessment of the interplay of ecological processes and the resultant biogeochemical signals, such as Fe-mediated increases in haptophyte abundances (table S2) and consequent faunistic shifts within the microzooplankton (20) (table S2) that lead to changes in dimethyl sulfoniopropionate (DMSP) (20) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) concentrations (20) (Table 1), respectively. These changes in DMS concentration demonstrate that climate-reactive biogenic gases-in addition to CO2-must be considered to obtain the cumulative effect of Fe enrichment on climate. The scale of FeAXs, and in particular their use of the SF6 tracer, enabled the construction of pelagic biogeochemical budgets for C (17) and Fe (21) under high-Fe conditions. FeAXs have permitted the study of whether speciation controls Fe bioavailability (22), the mechanisms behind changes in the production of Fe-binding ligands (FeBLs) in response to enhanced Fe (table S3), and other aspects of Fe chemistry. The SF6 tracer has also helped demonstrate that the underlying physics at FeAX sites alters the bloom biogeochemical signature both by diluting phytoplankton stocks (Table 1) and by increasing the macronutrient inventory of the patch (table S3). Such patch dilution may result in experimental artifacts including arrested bloom development (23), which leads to reduced macronutrient uptake. Together, the wide range of experimental conditions and resulting breadth of bloom signatures evident from FeAXs (Table 1 and tables S1 to S3) provide an essential data resource to improve existing ecological and biogeochemical models and to develop new ones. For example, a new model of DMS dynamics developed during Subarctic Ecosystem Response to Iron Enrichment Study (SERIES) provides a better understanding of how the complex interplay of physical, photochemical, and biological processes affects the temporal evolution of mixed-layer DMS concentrations (24). Scaling Up the Results from FeAXs A key issue to be addressed is how natural or anthropogenic variability in Fe supply affects ocean biogeochemistry and global climate (25). FeAXs are relatively short-term experiments specifically designed to test whether Fe supply limits primary production in HNLC waters, and therefore they can address this issue only by extrapolation. Here, we consider whether findings from FeAXs can successfully be scaled up temporally (seasonal to geological) and spatially (regional to global). Four issues, addressed below, are central to tests of the validity of such extrapolation. Macronutrient Uptake The degree of Fe-mediated algal uptake of the mixed-layer macronutrient inventory will determine bloom longevity (17) and influence the magnitude of C sequestration (1, 3). FeAXs, on a time scale of weeks, have exhibited a wide range of nutrient uptake (table S3), with depletion of >0.75 and >0.6 of the mixed-layer silicate and nitrate inventory, respectively, in several cases (table S2). Polar FeAXs, although of longer duration (Table 1), have resulted in 0, primary production is ultimately macronutrient-limited; if Fe* 1 mg chlorophyll m-3) after episodic dust deposition into both HNLC (37) and low nutrient-low chlorophyll (LNLC) waters (38). During the glacial maxima, increases in Fe supply are evident over a time scale of centuries (1). Aerosol Fe supply to the Southern Ocean during the glacial maxima was higher than at present by a factor of 10 (1, 39). The magnitude of this supply is potentially comparable to that during FeAXs and FeNXs (Fig. 2). However, there are uncertainties about the mode of Fe supply during glacial maxima. Supply was either episodic and localized from dust storms [e.g., Patagonia (39)] and/or sustained and global, being driven by Southern Ocean upwelling and oceanic circulation (40) in conjunction with global dust deposition as the main Fe source (14). A major unknown in the geological past is the fate of Fe incorporated into phytoplankton blooms. Was dust-mediated Fe supply lost to the deep ocean as declining blooms sank [as aggregates (23)], or was it efficiently recycled by biota in the subsurface ocean and subsequently upwelled? Uncertainty over the fate of Fe is highlighted by comparing two modeling studies. They indicate that substantial atmospheric CO2 drawdown resulted from the routes of high dust deposition with no Fe recycling (41) and from lower rates of dust deposition with recycling and subsequent upwelling (14). The pulsed Fe supply in FeAXs may therefore be more relevant to a paleo-ocean with episodic dust supply (weeks) and Fe export to the deep ocean, whereas FeNXs are a better proxy if Fe supply was sustained (months) by upwelling and recycling. Comparison of the results of FeAXs and FeNXs via modeling studies will provide insights into how different modes of Fe supply affect oceanic Fe and C biogeochemistry. Coupled Iron-Carbon Biogeochemistry The degree to which the biogeochemical Fe and C cycles are linked is central to determining the impact of increased Fe supply on atmospheric CO2 drawdown and global climate in the geological past. A key parameter is the efficiency of phytoplankton C fixation per unit DFe [i.e., (POC formation)/(Fe supplied), where POC is particulate organic carbon], as the resulting POC export term will set the atmospheric drawdown efficiency [(air-sea CO2 exchange)/(POC exported)]. Also, because Fe supply during the geological past was elevated for centuries (Fig. 2D), it is important to determine the fate of C relative to Fe in the upper ocean over longer time scales: Is Fe retained via remineralization in the water column or exported to the sediments? [i.e., (DIC remineralized)/(Fe remineralized) and (POC exported)/(PFe exported), where DIC is dissolved inorganic carbon]. There are few published data on Fe/C ratios for particle production, remineralization, or export (Fig. 3). A range of three orders of magnitude in Fe/C molar ratios is evident, which is probably due to the use of different approaches as well as actual differences in C and Fe biogeochemistry. This variability in Fe/C ratios has been ascribed to a number of processes, such as differential remineralization of Fe and C on sinking particles [due to processes including scavenging on Fe (36, 42)], which results in increased PFe/POC ratios with depth (Fig. 3). Also, phytoplankton in high-Fe surface waters may take up more Fe per unit of C fixed [i.e., "luxury" Fe uptake (13, 43)], resulting in greater Fe remineralization than C remineralization on sinking particles relative to particles in HNLC waters (33). The available data on PFe/POC ratios indicate that settling particles from natural blooms (northeast Atlantic; Fe/C molar ratio 2.7 * 10-4) and FeAXs (Fe/C molar ratio 3.1 * 10-4 to 2.1 * 10-3) have higher ratios than those in HNLC waters (Fig. 3). During FeAXs, much of the Fe added is rapidly lost via precipitation and patch dilution (21); hence, Fe/C ratios from FeAXs will be overestimated by a factor of more than 2 (Fig. 3). Moreover, the time scales of FeAXs do not permit the fate of Fe (recycled or exported) initially added to the mixed layer to be assessed (44), and hence the ultimate efficiency of (Fe added):(C sequestered to depth) cannot be determined. Thus, upscaling the Fe:C stoichiometry from FeAXs to greater spatial and temporal scales is not currently recommended. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

The ratios were derived from a wide range of approaches including algal lab cultures (53), sediment traps (42), vertical nutrient profiles in HNLC waters (1), and particle regeneration from apparent oxygen use versus DFe (33, 43). Assessing the bioavailability of Fe (22) is a confounding factor in estimating Fe:C ratios, over and above the effect of patch dilution in FeAXs on the fate of the added Fe. The Fe/C ratios derived from FeAXs in (B) are (Fe added):(C exported) and assume that the Fe term is the total amount of Fe added, which may overestimate this ratio by 100% or more (21, 55). The Future: Key Questions and Approaches Key findings from FeAXs offer insights for modelers, although a limited number of these findings can be extrapolated directly to regional and seasonal scales for Fe enrichment. Such limited extrapolation relates to limitations in the FeAX design (7) and to uncertainties in our understanding of Fe biogeochemistry in the paleo-ocean. Key questions center around the issues of macronutrient use, ecosystem responses, modes of Fe supply, and coupling of Fe-C biogeochemical cycles, for which we propose three hypotheses. First, with respect to macronutrient uptake and ecosystem dynamics, we hypothesize that in addition to magnitude, the stoichiometry of macronutrient and Fe supply to HNLC surface waters is equally critical in determining whether blooms are transient (weeks) or sustained (months). This in turn will dictate the planktonic community that develops and the subsequent biogeochemical balance between Fe recycling within, and export from, the surface mixed layer. Second, although the mode of Fe supply is important (Fig. 2), the factors that influence the availability of the Fe supplied to the biota are critical. We hypothesize that the magnitude of the Fe available to the biota will be determined by the mode of Fe supply and in particular by the subsequent mobilization and retention of this Fe by upper-ocean processes. For aeolian Fe supply, these processes include aerosol Fe mixed-layer residence time (32), photochemistry, FeBL concentrations (25) and their joint impact on aerosol dissolution, and the ability of bacteria to access lithogenic PFe (42). The bioavailability of Fe supplied from upwelling may be influenced by processes such as photochemistry or by the concentration and binding strength of the upwelled Fe and FeBL relative to those in the surface mixed layer. Regarding the issue of Fe and C biogeochemistry, we offer a third hypothesis: that the relative importance of the processes that set particulate Fe/C ratios and their controlling factors will vary both regionally and seasonally. These processes, which will dictate Fe and C export, include algal Fe uptake and the differential rates of particle remineralization for Fe and C in surface and subsurface waters. Each of these, in turn, will be determined by a range of factors such as DFe concentration [algal Fe uptake (43)], food web structure and grazing activity [remineralization rates (45)], and particle properties and transformations including sinking rate or scavenging [export efficiency (36, 42)]. Testing these hypotheses will require both specific and multistranded approaches that link FeAXs, FeNXs, and biogeochemical Fe and C studies in a range of locales. Three are advocated: Modeling studies to apply our improved understanding of Fe biogeochemistry in the modern ocean to the geological past. Model simulations should also capitalize on the complementary approaches offered by FeAXs and FeNXs into how pulsed versus sustained Fe supply affects ecosystem dynamics and biogeochemistry. Improved experimental designs to overcome the limitations of FeAXs, such as smaller and more frequent Fe doses, greater patch length scale (>>10 km), and additional measurements that provide insight into the impact of Fe enrichment on climate (e.g., biogenic gases) or Fe cycling (e.g., fate of Fe). Detailed comparison of the biogeochemistry of differing FeNXs would help us understand better the influence of a range of Fe:macronutrient stoichiometries on bloom dynamics and C biogeochemistry. Such experiments require application of both existing [aircraft, laser imaging detection and ranging (46)] and new [gliders, sensor arrays (47)] technologies, and should be linked to regional circulation models with embedded biogeochemistry. The utility of shipboard Fe enrichments to study algal physiology in detail should not be overlooked (15). Biogeochemical studies to jointly measure key properties in the Fe and C cycles, such as Fe/C ratios and FeBL concentrations associated with particle transformations, will require specific investigation of end members-HNLC, LNLC, and high-Fe waters in coastal and offshore waters. These, in conjunction with the improved experimental designs described above, will provide insights into temporal and spatial controls on Fe/C ratios in both high- and low-Fe regimes.
Abstract The 66-kilodalton isoform of the growth factor adapter Shc (p66Shc) translates oxidative damage into cell death by acting as reactive oxygen species (ROS) producer within mitochondria. However, the signaling link between cellular stress and mitochondrial proapoptotic activity of p66Shc was not known. We demonstrate that protein kinase C , activated by oxidative conditions in the cell, induces phosphorylation of p66Shc and triggers mitochondrial accumulation of the protein after it is recognized by the prolyl isomerase Pin1. Once imported, p66Shc causes alterations of mitochondrial Ca2+ responses and three-dimensional structure, thus inducing apoptosis. These data identify a signaling route that activates an apoptotic inducer shortening the life span and could be a potential target of pharmacological approaches to inhibit aging. The protein p66Shc (1-4) is an alternatively spliced isoform of a growth factor adapter that is phosphorylated upon oxidative stress (2). Ablation of the p66Shc gene causes life-span prolongation with no pathological consequence (2). A fraction of p66Shc localizes to mitochondria (3-5), where it binds to cytochrome c and acts as oxidoreductase, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and leading to organelle dysfunction and cell death (5). The route leading to p66Shc activation is still unclear. Phosphorylation of a critical serine (Ser36) is necessary (2), but the kinase responsible has not been identified. Moreover, mitochondrial p66Shc is unphosphorylated, indicating that additional regulatory elements must exist. Mitochondria receive, under stimulation by physiological agonists or toxic agents, Ca2+-mediated inputs (6-8) that are decoded into effects as diverse as metabolic stimulation and apoptosis (9). Ca2+ responsiveness is a highly sensitive readout of mitochondrial state: Partial defects in mitochondrial energization, as in mitochondrial diseases, cause defects in Ca2+ handling by the organelle (10). Moreover, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is modulated by regulatory proteins such as kinases. Some protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (11) specifically affect the responses of mitochondrial Ca2+ to agonists (PKC reduces them, whereas PKC enhances them) (12). PKCs are also proposed to be activated in conditions of oxidative stress (13). We therefore used aequorin to monitor cellular concentrations of Ca2+, a green fluorescent protein with mitochondrial presequence (mtGFP) to monitor organelle structure, and other molecular tools to clarify the signaling route linking the oxidative challenge to the activation of p66Shc proapoptotic effect within mitochondria in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (14). Using an aequorin probe targeted by a mitochondrial presequence (mtAEQ) (15), we investigated organelle Ca2+ responses to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), an extracellular agonist that causes the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. p66Shc-/- and wild-type MEFs showed similar responses of [Ca2+]m to ATP, both in amplitude and in kinetics (Fig. 1, A and B). This reflects a close similarity in the global Ca2+ signaling patterns. Indeed, the monitoring of concentration of free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) showed that the [Ca2+]c rises evoked by ATP in p66Shc-/- and wild-type MEFs were virtually superimposable (Fig. 1, A and B, insets).

To investigate the effect of an oxidative challenge, we treated cells for 30 min before the application of ATP with various concentrations of H2O2. Reduction of mitochondrial Ca2+ responses and fragmentation of the three-dimensional mitochondrial network (16) was observed in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 1, A and a) several hours before signs of apoptosis (cell shrinkage and nuclear condensation, for example) were detected (fig. S1), whereas minor changes in the Ca2+ response and morphology were detected in p66Shc-/- MEFs (Fig. 1, B and b). This alteration in Ca2+ response was characteristically mitochondrial, because no difference in the ATP-dependent [Ca2+]c rise was detected between p66Shc-/- and wild-type H2O2-treated MEFs (Fig. 1, A and B, insets). The reintroduction of p66Shc reestablished sensitivity to H2O2 in p66Shc-/- MEFs (Figs. 1C-c). Production of ROS by p66Shc (5) influences the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) (17). We thus investigated whether the Ca2+ and morphology changes triggered by H2O2 could be prevented by the PTP blocker cyclosporine A (CsA). In CsA-treated wild-type MEFs, the rise in [Ca2+]m evoked by ATP stimulation in the presence of H2O2 was largely restored (Fig. 2A) and the integrity of the mitochondrial network was preserved (Fig. 2a). On the contrary, no effect of CsA on p66Shc-/- (Fig. 2A, inset) or on MEFs not treated with H2O2 (fig. S2, A and B) was detected. Similar results were obtained with bongkrekic acid, another PTP inhibitor (fig. S2, C and c). Mitochondrial Ca2+ responses and morphology were not modified by H2O2 application to p66Shc-/- MEFs in which either the p66Shc E132Q-E133Q mutant (p66Shcqq), incapable of binding cytochrome c (5) (Fig. 2, B and b), or the p66Shc S36A mutant (2) (Fig. 2, C and c) had been reintroduced, indicating that both the oxidoreductase activity of p66Shc and the phosphorylation of Ser36 are essential for the H2O2-induced proapoptotic changes.

FCCP (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, completely collapses the . The traces are representative of single cell responses. Overexpression of PKC mimicked the activation of the endogenous kinase by oxidative challenges, causing a reduction in [Ca2+]m responses in wild-type MEFs (in which the putative downstream effector is present) but not in p66Shc-/- MEFs (Fig. 3B). This effect was specific for PKC. When other isoforms were expressed (PKC, PKC, PKC mu , or PKC), the p66Shc-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ alteration was not observed (fig. S3). Moreover, when PKC was inhibited pharmacologically with hispidin (Fig. 3C) or its abundance was decreased with RNA interference (RNAi) (Fig. 3D), the [Ca2+]m peak was minimally affected by the application of H2O2. Similarly, hispidin treatment preserved mitochondrial morphology (Fig. 3E). We verified whether PKC inhibition reduced the apoptotic efficacy of H2O2 treatment. We measured cell viability 8 hours after the addition of 1 mM H2O2 by counting surviving cells on the microscopy stage. Hispidin caused no change in cell viability in wild-type cells but increased the number of cells surviving oxidative stress (29% 2.1 in H2O2-treated cells versus 60% 4.75 in hispidin pretreated cells, expressed as a percentage of the cells counted on a coverslip not exposed to H2O2) (fig. S5A). To partially mimic an "aging" event, we analyzed mitochondrial Ca2+ responses in MEFs maintained in culture for 20 passages. In wild-type MEFs, the [Ca2+]m responses gradually decreased with time in culture, whereas no alteration was observed in p66Shc-/- MEFs or in wild-type MEFs if the culture medium was supplemented with hispidin (fig. S5B). We also analyzed the effect of PKC on other mitochondrial parameters: mitochondrial membrane potential () and production of ROS (14). PKC activation by TPA caused a gradual reduction in in wild-type but not in p66Shc-/- MEFs (Fig. 3F and fig. S5C) (4). An increase in ROS production was observed shortly after infection of cells with an adenoviral vector driving PKC expression: dihydroethidium fluorescence intensity (arbitrary units) 17.70 1.2 versus 14.97 1.3 in nontransduced cells, supporting the view that PKC triggers the oxidoreductase activity of p66Shc. We suspected that a possible link between PKC-dependent phosphorylation of p66Shc and its mitochondrial oxidoreductase activity was that phosphorylation mediated transfer of p66Shc from the cytosol to mitochondria. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 recognizes and induces cis-trans isomerization of pSer-Pro (or pThr-Pro) bonds, conferring phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes relevant for protein function (19, 20). Moreover, Pin1-/- MEFs are impaired in apoptosis after exposure to ultraviolet (UVc) radiation (21). We identified a putative consensus for Pin1 binding (Ser36/Pro37) in p66Shc. Pull-down experiments (14) with Pin1 linked to glutathione S-transferase (GST-Pin1) showed that Pin1 bound to p66Shc after exposure of cells to UVc radiation that caused phosphorylation of p66Shc. This interaction appeared to be phosphorylation dependent because it was reduced by treatment of cell extracts with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP). Furthermore, the nonphosphorylatable mutant p66Shc S36A did not show detectable binding to Pin1 (Fig. 4A). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 4.

(D) Effects of okadaic acid (1 1/2M, 1 hour) on H2O2-dependent reduction of [Ca2+]m responses ([Ca2+]m peak, 7.58 0.33 1/2M versus 6.83 0.24 1/2M, in okadaic acid pretreated cells before and after H2O2 treatment, respectively). All conditions as in Fig. 1. (E) Western blot of p66Shc protein levels in the mitochondrial fraction and in the cell homogenate from wt and Pin1-/- MEFs. We investigated the mitochondrial effects of H2O2 treatment in Pin1-/- MEFs. In Pin1-/- cells, the H2O2-dependent reduction of the [Ca2+]m peak was smaller than that of wild-type MEFs (Fig. 4B). Similarly, in Pin1-/- MEFs, morphological changes caused by H2O2 were minimal (fig. S6A). Overexpression of Pin1 sensitized cells to weaker oxidative stress. When wild-type MEFs were subjected to mild oxidative stress (100 1/2M H2O2 for 15 min instead of 1 mM for 30 min), no alteration in the agonist-dependent [Ca2+]m transient was detected, whereas in Pin1 overexpressing cells, the peak was reduced (Fig. 4C). In certain substrates, the phosphoserine-proline (phosphoS-P) sites, once isomerized by Pin1, are recognized and dephosphorylated by PP2A (20). In cells treated with okadaic acid (PP2A inhibitor), the reduction in agonist-dependent [Ca2+]m responses was markedly smaller (Fig. 4D) than that in wild-type cells, which might suggest that dephosphorylation by PP2A follows Pin1 recognition and is necessary for the mitochondrial effects of p66Shc. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that Pin1-dependent isomerization of p66Shc enhances the transfer of the protein to the organelle. We evaluated the mitochondrial pool of p66Shc in wild-type and Pin1-/- MEFs by subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting (Fig. 4E and fig. S6B) (14). In wild-type cells, oxidative stress increased the amount of p66Shc within mitochondria (1/2+100%). This effect appeared to depend on PKC activity, because a similar increase was evoked by treatment of cells with TPA, and hispidin inhibited the effects of H2O2 treatment. Blots of total homogenate showed only a small increase in the total amount of p66Shc (1/2+15%) (4), indicating that there was net translocation of p66Shc to the organelle. In Pin1-/- MEFs, the mitochondrial fraction of p66Shc was smaller, both at rest or after treatment with H2O2 or TPA. TPA had no detectable effect on localization of p66Shc in the Pin1-/- cells. Overall, these data highlight a molecular route that links an oxidative challenge to the activation of p66Shc and the recruitment of mitochondria in apoptosis and may contribute to the aging properties of this protein.
Abstract Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is a key compound in global sulfur and carbon cycles. DMS oxidation products cause cloud nucleation and may affect weather and climate. DMS is generated largely by bacterial catabolism of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a secondary metabolite made by marine algae. We demonstrate that the bacterial gene dddD is required for this process and that its transcription is induced by the DMSP substrate. Cloned dddD from the marine bacterium Marinomonas and from two bacterial strains that associate with higher plants, the N2-fixing symbiont Rhizobium NGR234 and the root-colonizing Burkholderia cepacia AMMD, conferred to Escherichia coli the ability to make DMS from DMSP. The inferred enzymatic mechanism for DMS liberation involves an initial step in which DMSP is modified by addition of acyl coenzyme A, rather than the immediate release of DMS by a DMSP lyase, the previously suggested mechanism. Large amounts of DMSP are produced annually by many marine phytoplankton (1-3), seaweed macroalgae (4), and some angiosperms, including the salt marsh grass Spartina (5). For these organisms, DMSP is an osmoprotectant, which is released during physiological and mechanical stress, viral lysis, or grazer attack (6). Much of this is then catabolized through microbial action, mostly by marine bacteria (7-9). DMSP catabolism is hypothesized to occur through one of two pathways (7, 10). The dominant process, which carries about 80% of the total global flux, involves demethylation of DMSP (10). The other, DMSP lyase, route (7) involves a different enzymatic cleavage of DMSP (Fig. 1) that results in DMS, the predominant form of sulfur emitted from marine environments. DMS oxidation products nucleate cloud formation, increasing the albedo over the oceans, and hence may contribute to a reduction in global temperatures (2). DMS is also a potent chemoattractant for some crustaceans (copepods) and birds (shearwaters and petrels) as a marker for their potential food supplies (11, 12). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Representation of conventional and revised pathways for DMSP catabolism. The dotted, central line portrays the DMSP lyase pathway. Box 1 shows the demethylation pathway, the first step being catabolized by DmdA (14). Box 2 shows our suggested incomplete pathway, derived from predicted general functions of DddD. Recently, a gene, dmdA, which specifies a DMSP demethylase, was identified in Silicibacter pomeroyi DSS-3, a marine -proteobacterium that can also form DMS from DMSP (13, 14). Orthologs of this demethylase occur in many marine bacteria, including the abundant Pelagibacter ubique (14). No gene(s) involved in the DMSP lyase pathway are known, although several classes of bacteria grow with DMSP as the sole carbon source, releasing DMS when they do so (7). We term this phenotype Ddd+ (DMSP-dependent DMS). To identify some of the key ddd genes, we sampled bacteria from root surfaces of the salt marsh grass Spartina anglica and grew them with DMSP as the sole carbon source (15). We purified a DMSP-catabolizing bacterium (strain MWYL1), which had a 16S rRNA sequence 99% identical to that of Marinomonas, a marine -proteobacterium genus known to include Ddd+ strains (16). Cultures of MWYL1 were grown in minimal media with either DMSP, glycerol, or both as carbon sources and assayed for DMS production. DMS was produced only if cells were pregrown with DMSP (with or without glycerol), demonstrating that DMSP pretreatment induced DMS-synthesizing activity 100-fold in Marinomonas (Table 1). Table 1. Effects of cloned and mutant ddd genes and pregrowth in DMSP on DMS production. Wild-type and Ddd- mutant Marinomonas MWYL1, B. cepacia AMMD, Rhizobium NGR234, and E. coli containing various combinations of cloned ddd genes were examined. Strains were grown in appropriate minimal media with glycerol (G) or glycerol plus DMSP (G + D). DMS emissions are in nmol DMS min-1 mg dry weight-1. Details of pBIO plasmids containing cloned ddd genes are in table S1. ND indicates not detectable; NT, not tested. Values for Marinomonas MWYL1 wild type grown in DMSP as sole C source averaged 12,095 302 ( SE), indicating that the addition of a second, utilizable carbon source may slightly depress DMS emission.

No primary transfectants grew when DMSP was provided as the sole carbon source, but one E. coli transfectant produced DMS when grown on medium with DMSP plus glycerol. Retransformation of E. coli confirmed that this Ddd+ phenotype was due to this fosmid. Through subcloning, we identified two predicted transcriptional units, termed dddD and dddTBCR (containing dddT, dddB, dddC, and dddR), which are transcribed divergently from each other (Fig. 2). These two operons, along with their promoter regions, were subcloned individually. We found that E. coli containing either dddD or dddTBCR, each with their native promoters, produced no DMS when grown on DMSP. Therefore, both of these operons are required for the Ddd+ phenotype. We also cloned dddD into a vector (pET21a) where its expression was induced by isopropyl--thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). E. coli containing this plasmid formed DMS (500 nmol DMS min-1 mg dry weight-1) from DMSP but only upon IPTG addition. Thus, dddD alone confers a Ddd+ phenotype if expressed from an ectopic promoter. The failure of dddD to confer a Ddd+ phenotype when controlled by its own promoter suggested that it required a positively acting transcriptional regulator, most likely encoded by the dddTBCR operon. This was confirmed; in the presence of DMSP, subcloned dddR alone activated expression of a transcriptional fusion in which dddD, with its native promoter, was fused to lacZ (Table 2). Consistent with this, the sequence of DddR showed that it was in the LysR family of bacterial transcriptional regulators. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

The closest DddD homolog (26% identity) with known function is E. coli CaiB, a -butyrobetainyl-CoA:carnitine CoA-transferase that adds acyl CoA to the amino acid carnitine, a molecule with structural similarity to DMSP. The Marinomonas MWYL1 Ddd proteins were >93% identical to proteins in the closely related Marinomonas strains MED121 and HTCC2207. Furthermore, the Ddd+ marine -proteobacteria S. pomeroyi DSS-3 and Sagittula stellata E37 both have proteins with 1/240% identity to DddD of Marinomonas (13) (fig. S1). Two other bacterial strains not previously known to catabolize DMSP have proteins about 60% identical to Marinomonas DddD. These are the -proteobacterial N2-fixing, symbiotic Rhizobium NGR234, which induces nodules on many different legumes and on the nonlegume Parasponia (17, 18), and the -proteobacterium Burkholderia cepacia AMMD, found on roots of many angiosperms (19). Neither Rhizobium NGR234 nor B. cepacia AMMD grew on DMSP as sole carbon source, but both emitted DMS when grown with DMSP plus another carbon source. As with Marinomonas, their Ddd+ phenotype was induced by DMSP (Table 1). When dddD homologs of Rhizobium NGR234 and B. cepacia AMMD were individually cloned and supplied by a promoter in the vector, they both conferred a Ddd+ phenotype to E. coli (Table 1). Other strains of Rhizobium and Burkholderia that lack dddD (15) made no DMS on media containing DMSP plus glycerol. The closest homolog to Marinomonas DddR was a protein of 60% identity from B. cepacia AMMD (Fig. 2). The cloned AMMD dddR-like gene, which is adjacent to dddD of this species, fully induced expression of Marinomonas dddD-lacZ in E. coli that was pregrown with DMSP (Table 2). Thus, B. cepacia DddR activates expression of dddD of the distantly related Marinomonas. To confirm the importance of dddD and dddR in DMSP catabolism in Marinomonas, we made transposon insertions in each of these genes (15). Neither the DddD- nor the DddR- mutants grew on DMSP as the sole carbon source, and neither made DMS in DMSP plus glycerol medium (Table 1). Further, the dddD-lacZ fusion was not expressed in the DddR- mutant. Although the Marinomonas dddT, dddB, and dddC genes were not required to confer a Ddd+ phenotype to E. coli, their location suggested that they might be involved in DMSP catabolism. DddT may be required for DMSP uptake because it is in the betaine-carnitine-choline-transporter (BCCT) family, whose members transport different betaine molecules. DddB is in the family of Fe-containing alcohol dehydrogenases, and DddC is a predicted methylmalonatesemialdehyde dehydrogenase-like protein. In E. coli, the transporters for betaine (BetU) and carnitine (CaiT) are, respectively, 45% and 27% identical to DddT and so may substitute for the bona fide DddT of Marinomonas. The two Ddd+ strains of Rhizobium and Burkholderia have unusually wide host ranges on angiosperms, so we speculate that their hosts may include species that, like Spartina, make DMSP. Neither B. cepacia nor Rhizobium NGR234 used DMSP as a sole carbon source under our conditions. However, their partial catabolism of DMSP, forming DMS, may have a role in detoxification or in signaling. Also unexpected is that the predicted function of DddD is a type III acyl CoA transferase, very different from the DMSP lyase that was hypothesized to cleave DMSP directly (7) (Fig. 1). Given its homology to E. coli CaiB, DddD is predicted to add CoA to DMSP, a key step preceding subsequent cleavage and release of DMS. The proposed DMSP-CoA thioester may be catabolized by one or more steps to DMS plus 3-hydroxypropionate (Fig. 1). This scheme could accommodate the observations (20) that a Ddd+ -proteobacterium, when grown on DMSP, produced DMS and accumulated 3-hydroxypropionate but not acrylate, a predicted product of DMSP lyase (Fig. 1). CaiB of E. coli is a homodimer of two separate CaiB polypeptides (21). In contrast, the DddD proteins in the Ddd+ bacteria shown in fig. S1 are all about twice the size of E. coli CaiB and comprise tandem, imperfect repeats separated by a poorly conserved linker (fig. S1). The homology between these DddD intramolecular repeats is greatest at their N-termini, which include the active site for CaiB (fig. S1). Therefore, a single DddD polypeptide may form the dimer-type structure for acyl CoA transferases whose substrate is DMSP. The genes in the published Sargasso Sea bacterial metagenome (22) include one homolog each of DddD (58% identical) and DddR (60% identical). Therefore, the Ddd system occurs in oceanic bacteria, although less frequently than does the DmdA DMSP demethylase (14). Other bacteria may have different ways of making DMS from DMSP, because we noted that dddD homologs are absent from two other DMS-emitting strains, Sulfitobacter sp. EE-36 and Roseovarius nubinhibens ISM. It will be of interest to determine the range of different mechanisms for DMSP catabolism in bacteria and to understand their roles in global sulfur and carbon cycles.

Abstract Femtosecond time-resolved infrared spectroscopy was used to study the formation of cyclobutane dimers in the all-thymine oligodeoxynucleotide (dT)18 by ultraviolet light at 272 nanometers. The appearance of marker bands in the time-resolved spectra indicates that the dimers are fully formed 1/21 picosecond after ultraviolet excitation. The ultrafast appearance of this mutagenic photolesion points to an excited-state reaction that is approximately barrierless for bases that are properly oriented at the instant of light absorption. The low quantum yield of this photoreaction is proposed to result from infrequent conformational states in the unexcited polymer, revealing a strong link between conformation before light absorption and photodamage. The most abundant lesion in ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated DNA is the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) that is formed between adjacent thymine bases (Fig. 1) (1). This mutagenic photoproduct disrupts the normal cellular processing of DNA and leads to a complex web of biological responses, including apoptosis, immune suppression, and carcinogenesis (2-4). Organisms possess elaborate repair pathways to counter this constant threat to genomic integrity. Aside from their biological importance, CPDs are of interest as structural reporters. Thymine-dimer yields are not the same at all TT doublets in a given DNA sequence, but these yields depend, in poorly understood ways, on the identity of the flanking bases and on local conformation (1). By exposing DNA to UV light and then measuring the relative photoproduct yields with single-nucleotide resolution, it has been possible in favorable cases to obtain structural information (5-7). In order for this methodology to achieve its full potential, molecular-level understanding of the dimerization mechanism is essential. We report a dynamic study of thymine dimerization that provides insight into the coupling between DNA structure and DNA photodamage. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Schematic of the photodynamics of the DNA oligomer (dT)18. The DNA's sugar-phosphate backbone is shown as a gray ribbon in the partial structures. UV excitation populates a singlet * state. This state decays overwhelmingly via internal conversion (IC) to the S0 ground state. To a smaller extent, the population of the * state branches to a singlet n* state. Intersystem crossing to a triplet state has been detected in thymine but not in polymeric DNA. Finally, the * state can decay to a dimer photoproduct (middle residues with new bonds shown in red) if a reactive conformation is present at the time of excitation. CPD formation is a [2+2] photocycloaddition reaction in which the carbon-carbon double bonds of proximal pyrimidine bases react to form a cyclobutane ring. In the analogous reaction between two ethylene molecules, electronic excitation and the proper orientation of the reacting double bonds are needed for the reaction to occur (8). Unlikethe caseof freeethylene molecules, pyrimidine bases in DNA are tethered to the sugar-phosphate backbone, and this tethering restricts the achievable orientations. Some conformations are simply impossible because of backbone constraints. Thus, a single CPD isomer (the cis-syn isomer shown in Fig. 1) is formed in UV-irradiated oligo- and polynucleotides, whereas two thymine molecules diffusing freely in aqueous solution yield all six stereoisomers (1). Because DNA is moderately flexible, a vast number of conformations exist. Some of these have the bases positioned favorably for a reaction, whereas others do not. DNA is highly dynamic, and motions such as the stacking and unstacking of bases, base-pair breathing and opening, torsional oscillations, and helix bending will incessantly bring a given bipyrimidine doublet into and out of favorable geometries for dimerization. The impact of these motions on the reaction kinetics depends on how their rates compare to the rate of reaction by favorably oriented bases (9). Direct kinetic measurements of dimerization can thus elucidate the potentially complex interactions between conformational dynamics and photodamage. In an excited-state reaction, motion along the reaction coordinate occurs in competition with energy-wasting steps such as fluorescence and internal conversion to the electronic ground state. In the past few years, it has become possible to directly observe the dynamics of excited electronic states in DNA model compounds by femtosecond spectroscopy (10, 11). It has been proposed that the very high rate of nonradiative decay by the singlet *(1*) states of single nucleobases can greatly restrict photodamage (10). However, recent work has revealed the presence of additional, rather long-lived singlet states in DNA (11) and single bases (12). In oligodeoxynucleotides, lifetimes of 100 ps have been observed, depending on base stacking and base sequence (11). Additionally, at least 10% of all singlet excitations in single pyrimidine bases such as thymidine 5'-monophosphate (TMP) decay to singlet n*(1n*) excited states with lifetimes in excess of 10 ps (11). Kinetic measurements can determine which of these diverse excited states is the dimer precursor. Past efforts to observe dimerization kinetics have been unsuccessful. It has been shown by flash photolysis that photodimers are formed in the all-thymine oligodeoxynucleotide (dT)20 in 1/2270 nm. Because of its chemical bond specificity, vibrational spectroscopy can often unambiguously identify transient species and stable photoproducts (14). We therefore recorded time-resolved infrared spectra of a DNA model compound that was excited by a femtosecond UV pump pulse (15). The system studied was single-stranded (dT)18, which was chosen in order to maximize the number of dimers that were formed with each laser pulse. In this DNA model system, every absorbed photon excites a residue that is capable of dimerization. Quantum yields in the closely related systems poly(dT) (0.033) (16) and (dT)20 (0.028) (13) are among the highest reported for any DNA compound. In contrast, the dimerization quantum yield is over 30 times lower in double-stranded genomic DNA (17). This large reduction is due to the low frequency of TT doublets and the absorption by nonthymine bases in mixed-sequence DNA. After presenting our results for (dT)18, we will discuss the implications for double-stranded nucleic acids. Steady-state infrared (IR) absorption spectra of (dT)18 in D2O were recorded before and after UV irradiation at 266 nm, in order to locate IR marker bands that were indicative of dimerization. In the spectrum obtained before UV irradiation (black curve in Fig. 2A), three strong bands were observed at 1632, 1664, and 1693 cm-1. These bands, which arise from double-bond stretches associated with the two carbonyl groups and the C5=C6 double bond (18), bleached strongly after several minutes of UV exposure (Fig. 2A). Difference spectra were calculated by subtracting the steady-state IR spectrum from each spectrum of the UV-irradiated oligomer (Fig. 2B). Negative bleaching signals were apparent in the double-bond stretching region above 1600 cm-1. In addition, positive peaks between 1300 and 1500 cm-1 grew in with increasing exposure time. The IR absorption spectrum of the photoproduct (solid curve, Fig. 2C) was obtained from the difference spectra in Fig. 2B by target analysis (19), assuming that a single photoproduct is formed. In fact, a pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photo-adduct is also generated at TT doublets, but it can be neglected because its quantum yield is 50 times lower in poly(dT) (20). The absorption spectrum (Fig. 2D) of a previously described model compound of the cis-syn thymine dimer (21) is in excellent agreement with the solid trace in Fig. 2C, showing that this is the only dominant photoproduct under these conditions. Bands in the dimer spectrum substantially overlap those of unirradiated (dT)18 above 1500 cm-1. In contrast, a trio of marker bands is evident at 1320, 1402, and 1465 cm-1 (Fig. 2C), and these bands became the focus of the time-resolved experiments.

(D) Steady-state IR absorption spectrum of the cis-syn dimer model compound in D2O (structure shown at right). Broadband IR transient absorption signals were recorded between 1300 and 1550 cm-1 after excitation of (dT)18 by a femtosecond pump pulse at 272 nm (15). For comparison, measurements were carried out on TMP, which cannot dimerize on the time scales of interest here because of the slow rate of diffusional encounter by two TMP molecules. Transient spectra measured for both solutes are compared side-by-side in Fig. 3. Negative absorbance changes (bleaches) are colored blue, whereas positive signals are red. The bleaches monitor the repopulation of the starting material, whereas positive signals arise from the vibrational bands of excited states or photoproducts. At first glance, the transient IR spectra of TMP and (dT)18 are very similar. The quantum yield for dimerization in (dT)18 is just 2 to 3%, and most excitations in both systems decay nonradiatively on similar time scales (11). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3. Transient IR difference spectra at the indicated times after 272-nm excitation of TMP and (dT)18 in D2O solution in the photodimer marker-band region (typical errors are 1/210 1/2OD). Positive bands are shaded red, whereas negative signals are shaded blue. The green and purple curves at the top show the inverted steady-state IR spectra of each solute. Strong bands are indicated by the vertical dashed gray lines. The yellow dashed curve in the 3500-ps spectrum of TMP represents the steady-state difference IR spectrum obtained by raising the temperature of neat D2O (see SOM). After ultrafast internal conversion of the excited molecules, the transient spectra are dominated by the cooling dynamics of the hot ground states on a time scale of several picoseconds. Transient spectra at later delay times show the broad signature of the heated solvent. The residual bleach seen for TMP at 3 ns is assigned mainly to intersystem crossing to a triplet state [estimated quantum yield 0.02 (1)]. For (dT)18, one can see additional absorption due to the presence of thymine dimers. Dynamic events revealed by the time-resolved spectra in Fig. 3 that are common to both solutes are discussed first. Initially, UV excitation populates the lowest-energy 1* state, resulting in bleaches at frequencies corresponding to ground-state vibrations (dashed gray lines in Fig. 3). These bleaches have their maximum amplitudes near time zero, as seen in the spectra recorded 0.48 ps after the pump pulse. Positive signals are seen at this time at all frequencies where bleaching is not observed. These broad bands decay with a lifetime close to that of the 1* state [540 fs for thymidine (10)] and are no longer present in the 3.3-ps spectra. The short lifetime of this state is limited by internal conversion, which moves the population nonradiatively from the 1* state to the vibrationally excited electronic ground state. The photon energy is thus converted into sudden vibrational heating. This produces positive bands on the red edge of the negative bleach signals, resulting in distinctive sigmoidal line shapes (22) such as the one seen near 1480 cm-1 in the 3.3-ps spectra. These features disappear by vibrational energy transfer to the solvent (vibrational cooling), with a time constant of 2 to 4 ps (11, 14), and are no longer visible at 20 ps. The bleach near the maximum of each vibrational mode recovers in multiexponential fashion with similar kinetics as those that were previously recorded by transient absorption signals at UV wavelengths (11). The decay is 85 to 90% complete within 10 ps, whereas the remainder of the bleach recovers with time constants that vary between 100 and 1000 ps because of the decay of the 1n* population (12). A broad positive band near 1350 cm-1 decays on a 100-ps time scale and is tentatively assigned to this 1n* state. The spectra at 3 ns (Fig. 3) are dominated by a broad sigmoidal line shape, extending from 1300 to 1800 cm-1. This distinctive signature arises from a temperature-jump effect, which is described in the supporting online material (SOM) in more detail. The hot-water contribution to the transient spectrum appears within a few picoseconds, but it then remains constant in our time window because of slow heat transport out of the laser focus (23). There are subtle but significant differences between the time-resolved IR spectra in Fig. 3. Greater modulation in the 20-ps and 3.5-ns spectra for (dT)18 is due to absorption in the oligomer at each of the three marker-band frequencies that are identified in Fig. 2C. The difference is readily seen in a comparison of the transient spectra that are recorded for the two samples at a 3-ns delay time in the top panel of Fig. 4A. The water-heating signal is approximately the same for both samples because of the similar extent of ultrafast nonradiative decay. This signal can therefore be removed by subtracting the transient spectrum for TMP from the spectrum that was recorded at the same delay time for (dT)18. Difference spectra constructed in this manner are shown by the blue curves in Fig. 4A and as a contour plot between 1 and 25 ps in Fig. 4B. The subtraction procedure is discussed at length in the SOM. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 4. Difference spectra formed by subtracting the transient spectra of TMP from those of (dT)18. (A) The top panel shows the transient spectra of TMP and (dT)18 at 3 ns. Their difference is plotted below as the blue curve, together with a difference spectrum at 15 ps. The red curve at the bottom represents the stationary IR difference spectrum of (dT)18 (dashed curve in Fig. 2C) and the dimer photoproduct (solid curve in Fig. 2C). It displays the absorption difference due to dimer formation. Vertical dashed gray lines indicate the position of the cyclobutane dimer marker bands. (B) Contour plot of the difference spectrum. Red and blue colors represent strong positive and negative differences, respectively. A time slice showing the difference spectrum at 15 ps (horizontal dashed line in bottom panel) is shown in the top panel. Positive signals due to dimer formation are visible from 1/21 ps onward for the bands at 1402 and 1320 cm-1, as indicated by the vertical dashed lines. Because vibrational cooling dynamics differ for (dT)18 and TMP, incomplete subtraction in the spectral region around the 1480 cm-1 ground-state band obscures the 1465 cm-1 photodimer band at early times. The red trace in Fig. 4A is the difference spectrum calculated by subtracting the ground-state absorption spectrum of (dT)18 from the dimer spectrum of Fig. 2C. This trace represents the expected absorption changes induced by dimer formation. The transient difference spectra at 15 ps and 3 ns show positive peaks at each of the dimer marker-band frequencies and contributions from ground-state bleaching. The excellent agreement with the stationary spectrum shows unequivocally that thymine dimers are present 1/215 ps after excitation. The dynamics of the marker bands at earlier times can be seen in a contour plot of the transient difference spectrum between 1 and 25 ps (Fig. 4B). The positive marker bands at 1402 and 1320 cm-1 are clearly visible over the entire time range. The marker band at 1465 cm-1 is visible down to 4 ps, but it is obscured by vibrational cooling of hot thymine molecules at earlier delay times. Because TMP and (dT)18 exhibit different cooling dynamics (11), the vibrational cooling signatures do not fully cancel each other and instead show up in the difference plot in the vicinity of intense ground-state bands. Thus, the cooling dynamics from the hot 1480 cm-1 band (Fig. 3) cover the 1465 cm-1 marker band at early delay times. Cooling is also seen at other wavenumbers during the first few picoseconds; e.g., around 1350 cm-1. For delay times 1/230 1/2-optical density (OD) units. This is 3% of the initial bleach of 1 mOD that was seen 1 ps after photoexcitation at 1480 cm-1. This band has a cross section comparable to that of the three marker bands, so the reported dimerization yield of 2 to 3% (13, 24) should produce asignalof 20 to 30 1/2OD, as observed. The dimer yield at 1/21 ps thus equals the value from steady-state experiments within experimental uncertainty, demonstrating that dimerization is an ultrafast photoreaction. The high speed of this bond-forming reaction is noteworthy but not unprecedented. Ultrafast reaction rates are seen for some bimolecular reactions when the reactants are suitably preoriented (25). Also, the closely related intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition reaction of norbornadiene occurs in the gas phase in * state with the end product. This suggests that a conical intersection lies along this path as in computational studies of other pericyclic photoreactions (8). Dimerization in (dT)18 occurs more rapidly than many motions that could bring poorly oriented bases into a more favorable conformation for reaction. For example, base stacking and unstacking in thymine oligomers require tens of picoseconds, according to a molecular-dynamics study (27). Dimerization thus occurs only for thymine residues that are already in a reactive conformation at the instant of excitation (28, 29). Excited states of unfavorably oriented thymines are quenched before a change of conformation can occur. The extent of dimerization under steady-state irradiation thus depends on the fraction of time that a given doublet spends in reactive versus nonreactive conformations. Control of CPD formation by ground-state structure is fully consistent with the rapid saturation of CPD formation in poly(U) and poly(dT) in a rigid glass at 77 K as compared to room-temperature aqueous solution (30). This occurs because there is a finite number of reactive conformations in the low-temperature polymer, but the polymer in room-temperature solution is able to thermally fluctuate, allowing new reactive conformations to appear as exposure continues. Because the rate of reaction by favorably aligned thymines is much faster than the rate of conformational change, the quantum yield is equal to the fraction of reactive conformations multiplied by the probability that a reactive conformation dimerizes upon excitation (9). The latter quantity is unknown, but it is likely to approach unity based on the high quantum yields of dimerization in molecular crystals of some pyrimidine bases (31) and in dimers split in rigid matrices (32). With this assumption, the quantum yield for dimerization is simply the fraction of favorably oriented conformations. The low yields for all-thymine oligomers thus reveal that only a few percent of the TT doublets are favorably positioned for reaction at the time of excitation. This finding is consistent with the disordered structure of this rather flexible oligomer (33). Excited-state modeling is needed to fully characterize the reactive conformations, but some geometrical requirements are readily anticipated. Base stacking, which has been discussed in the past as a necessary criterion for reaction (30), reduces the distance between C5=C6 bonds as compared to an unstacked geometry. However, the dimer geometry suggests that a low value of the dihedral angle between the reacting double bonds may also be important. The conformational changes, such as partial helix unwinding and bending (34), that are observed near the site of a CPD are likely to be the same ones needed to make a conformation favorable for reaction (7). We fully expect thymine dimerization to be ultrafast in double-stranded DNA, based on the speed of the reaction in single-stranded (dT)18. Base pairing could affect the rates of nonreactive decay steps such as internal conversion by the precursor excited state, but we consider this to be unlikely, because recent time-resolved measurements show no effects due to base pairing on the dynamics of the excited states in AT-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (11). We conclude that dimerization occurs with equal speed for bipyrimidine doublets in single- and double-stranded contexts, provided that the TT geometry is similar for both contexts. Base pairing, on the other hand, will greatly influence the quantum yields by altering the distribution of conformations. The structures of flexible all-thymine oligomers (27, 33) and double-stranded mixed-sequence DNA differ substantially, yet the quantum yields calculated per photon absorbed by a dimerizable thymine (see SOM) are the same to within a factor of 1/22 in room-temperature aqueous solution (17, 35). This means that a small percentage of TT doublets react in double-stranded DNA, even though virtually all doublets are well stacked. We propose that the winding of base pairs around the helix axis [the average twist angle is 36 in the B-type DNA (B-DNA) conformation (36)] keeps the C5=C6 double bonds too far apart. In contrast, although base stacking in single-stranded thymine oligomers is rare, the more flexible backbone does not prevent these rare stacks from adopting conformations that are suitable for dimerization. A comparison of the literature that describes dimer yields in nucleic acids with A-type and B-type double-helical structures supports the hypothesis that dimerization in double-stranded DNA occurs as a result of uncommon conformations. The rate of dimer formation is decreased by up to a factor of 2 when double-stranded DNA is switched from the B-type to the A-type conformation (37). Even larger protective effects have been observed at TT steps in hairpins with A-type structure (38). The same base pairing is found in both structural classes, and the only difference is the distribution of accessible conformations. This evidence establishes that the conformation controls the reactivity in duplex DNA, just as in single-stranded (dT)18. The average twist angle between successive base pairs differs in A-DNA by only a few degrees when compared to B-DNA, suggesting that the ideal geometries in both helices are nonreactive. Instead, dimerization is proposed to take place at TT steps that deviate in just the right way from the average duplex structure. Thus, the smaller amount of conformational variation in A-type versus B-type structures (36) explains the greater resistance of A-DNA to CPD formation. The model we have derived from our results implies that static TT conformation (7, 29), and not conformational motions after photoexcitation (6, 39), determines the outcome of a reaction. Flexibility does not help an excitation at a bipyrimidine doublet attain a better conformation within its lifetime, but a more flexible backbone can increase the fraction of reactive conformations that are present at the time of light absorption. With knowledge about the conformational criteria that make reaction inevitable, molecular-dynamics simulation can be used to identify damage hot spots.

Please see:Is corrected by - February 16, 2007 Abstract Intense femtosecond laser excitation can produce transient states of matter that would otherwise be inaccessible to laboratory investigation. At high excitation densities, the interatomic forces that bind solids and determine many of their properties can be substantially altered. Here, we present the detailed mapping of the carrier density-dependent interatomic potential of bismuth approaching a solid-solid phase transition. Our experiments combine stroboscopic techniques that use a high-brightness linear electron accelerator-based x-ray source with pulse-by-pulse timing reconstruction for femtosecond resolution, allowing quantitative characterization of the interatomic potential energy surface of the highly excited solid. The availability of bright sources of ultrafast hard x-rays, such as future free-electron lasers, opens up the possibility to follow atomic motion stroboscopically with the picometer spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution required to capture the fastest atomic vibrations and the making and breaking of chemical bonds (1). However, the inability to precisely time the x-ray probe can lead to significant reduction in temporal resolution. Recently, the use of single-shot determination of the x-ray arrival time as a means of random sampling has been demonstrated to circumvent this problem (2). Using this technique, we conducted femtosecond laser-pump x-ray-probe experiments that elucidate the role that carrier-induced bond-softening and anharmonicity play in the high-amplitude phonon dynamics of photoexcited bismuth. The valence electrons and ionic cores (nucleus and core electrons) that constitute a crystalline solid, in general, can be considered as distinct components that couple through the electron-lattice interaction. In bismuth, as well as antimony and tellurium, the electron-lattice interaction is strong and the lattice configuration is sensitive to the population distribution of electrons within the conduction bands. In these materials, femtosecond photoexcitation of charge carriers drives the symmetric zone center A1g coherent optical phonon mode (3-5). The vibrational excitation is generally believed to be displacive: The population redistribution of valence electrons alters the potential energy surface of the lattice and gives rise to a restoring force that drives coherent atomic motion. The dynamics of this mode are determined by the curvature and minima location of the altered potential energy surface (quasi-equilibrium coordinate). Knowledge of electronically excited energy surfaces is essential for predictive models of nonequilibrium behavior in this and a wider class of important processes in nature (from photocatalysis to nonequilibrium charge transport in nanojunctions). Experimentally, the A1g vibrational mode has been monitored indirectly by measuring time-dependent optical reflectivity (3, 6-10) and directly by time-resolved x-ray diffraction measurements (11). However, with the latter technique, low x-ray flux prevented carrier-dependent studies of the interatomic potential. Recent observations in bismuth and tellurium reveal that the vibrational frequency is not constant: It red-shifts from the equilibrium value under high-intensity excitation, indicating a softened phonon mode (7, 9-12). After the initial softening, the oscillation frequency blue-shifts back toward the equilibrium value as the oscillation amplitude and carrier density decay (9, 10). The mechanism responsible for this time-dependent vibrational frequency shift, or chirp, has been controversial. Hase et al. concluded that the chirp was due to an amplitude-dependent frequency caused by anharmonicity of the interatomic potential (9). Fahy and Reis suggested an alternate explanation based on electronic softening of the potential and the subsequent dynamics of the photoexcited carriers (13). Optical coherent control experiments in which the phonon amplitude was varied at fixed electronic excitation demonstrated that the observed phonon frequency is dominated by electronic effects and that anharmonicity in the interatomic potential plays a negligible role, a finding that was supported by ab initio constrained density functional theory (DFT) calculations (10). However, because optical reflectivity does not measure atomic positions, the location of the potential energy minimum and the amplitude of the phonon-driven atomic displacement could not be determined. We used femtosecond x-ray diffraction to elucidate the dynamics of the high-amplitude phonons by direct measurement of the atomic positions within the unit cell. The knowledge of the time evolution of the atomic positions enables the determination of the quasi-equilibrium coordinate and curvature of the interatomic potential and the comparison of these parameters to previous DFT calculations. The potential well shifts and softens with increasing carrier density, corresponding to a highly excited solid in which a substantial fraction of the total valence electrons are promoted to the conduction bands. The room temperature structure of bismuth is rhombohedral A7 with two atoms per unit cell. This structure is a Peierls distortion of a simple cubic structure, with alternating atoms spaced nonequidistantly along the body diagonal or trigonal axis. Thus, there exists a double-well interatomic potential with normalized equilibrium coordinate at x = 0.5 (in units of the hexagonal unit cell length, c = 1.18 nm). The A1g mode consists of an oscillation of the two basis atoms along the trigonal direction, and thus x is also the phonon coordinate. is a measure of the Peierls distortion, that is, the deviation of each potential energy minimum from the symmetric x = 0.5 point. The quasi-equilibrium coordinate and shape of the well constraining the atoms along the trigonal direction are sensitive to excitation of carriers from the valence band to the conduction band (10). A 50-nm-thick bismuth film grown by molecular beam epitaxy with a (111) surface orientation (14) was excited at room temperature by near-infrared pulses [(70 fs full width at half maximum (FWHM)] propagating from a Ti:sapphire laser system in a direction colinear with the x-rays. The x-ray pulses (106 photons at 9 keV, 0.24 mm2 area, 100 fs duration) were generated from the Sub-Picosecond Pulse Source (SPPS) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The (111) x-ray Bragg reflection was observed for absorbed excitation fluences between 0.3 and 3.0 mJ/cm2 per pulse at a 10 Hz repetition rate (15). We note that at 1.5 mJ/cm2, enough energy is deposited to eventually raise the temperature of the entire film to the melting point, although at least 4.1 mJ/cm2 is required to provide the additional latent heat for thermal melting. It is in this high fluence regime that ultrafast excitation of carriers generates large-amplitude coherent phonons with a significantly lowered frequency. During the first few picoseconds after excitation, it appears that the absorbed energy is stored almost entirely in the electronic degrees of freedom and the mechanical vibration associated with the A1g mode. In this time, the volume of the unit cell remains fixed and the lattice remains at room temperature. On the time scale of 1/220 picoseconds, considerable uniaxial strain is observed as a shift in the Bragg angle. Thus, the observed changes in the diffraction efficiency at these early times (Fig. 1) are due to structural changes within the unit cell of the crystal. The structure factor for the (hkl) Bragg reflection is a function of the phonon coordinate (1) where fBi is the atomic scattering factor for bismuth. In the limit of a thin film and constant temperature, the normalized diffraction signal for the (111) reflection is a direct measure of the atomic displacement along the trigonal direction (2) A large transient decrease in diffraction efficiency occurs upon the arrival of the excitation pulse (t = 0) and is followed by damped oscillations superimposed upon a recovery. In the high-symmetry, non-Peierls distorted state, x = 0.5 and the (111) reflection is forbidden by symmetry. Thus, the transient decrease is attributed to a sudden shift in the minima location of the potential energy surface (toward x = 0.5) in the excited electronic state, leading to atomic oscillations about the shifted equilibrium. Measurements of the (222) reflection, which increases in intensity for the higher-symmetry arrangement, confirm this attribution. A similar behavior was observed by Sokolowski-Titen et al. (11). The quasi-equilibrium coordinate is then measured directly from the magnitude of the transient decrease of the relative diffraction efficiency seen in the (111) data (i.e., from the value about which the oscillations occur). The subsequent increase is ascribed to carrier relaxation through diffusion and recombination, which eventually restores the potential energy surface to its equilibrium shape at excitation levels below the damage threshold.

The zero-delay point was set at the half maximum of the initial transient drop. The inset displays the optical phonon frequency as a function of the normalized atomic equilibrium position along the body diagonal of the unit cell x as measured by x-ray diffraction. The dotted curve represents the theoretical prediction obtained from DFT calculations of the excited-state potentialenergy surface (10). The oscillatory part of the diffraction signal, corresponding to the coherent optical phonon mode, was fit to a decaying sinusoid with fixed frequency and varying initial phase. Because the phonon frequency is chirped, the frequency obtained from the fit represents the average phonon frequency over the fitting interval (1/20.5 to 1.5 ps). The measured value, ranging from 2.84 to 2.31 THz, is red-shifted relative to that observed in continuous wave Raman scattering experiments (2.93 THz) (8). Similar softening has been measured in optical experiments (7, 9, 10). The inset of Fig. 1 displays the dependence of phonon frequency on the quasi-equilibrium coordinate (measured over the same time interval as the phonon frequency). Our results also represent average values over the sample depth for both frequency and quasi-equilibrium coordinate, because the x-ray penetration depth is much larger than the film thickness. In the absence of photoexcitation, the accepted values of the frequency and equilibrium location at room temperature are 2.93 THz and x = 0.46719 (10, 16-18). At a measured quasi-equilibrium coordinate of x = 0.4729 0.0001, the well is shifted by 6.7 picometers and the interatomic forces are softened by 35% (1/220% decrease in the phonon frequency). The results are compared with the constrained DFT calculation of Murray et al. (10) (dotted line). These first-principles calculations assumed production of a single electron-hole pair per absorbed photon and rapid thermalization of the electrons and holes by intraband scattering, followed by electron-hole recombination on a longer time scale. Therefore, the electron and hole distributions are approximated as independent Fermi-Dirac distributions with separate chemical potentials such that the average energy of each pair is equal to the photon energy. Despite these approximations, the excellent agreement with experimental results here demonstrates the ability of DFT to quantitatively predict the essential excited-state features (quasi-equilibrium coordinate and frequency) of this system. Under the same assumption of a single electron-hole pair produced per absorbed photon, we separately compare the measured quasi-equilibrium coordinate as a function of carrier density to the DFT predictions (Fig. 2). The calculated double-well potential with the quasi-equilibrium coordinate is indicated by the dotted line (for illustrative purposes we arbitrarily chose the x 1/22.5% of the valence electrons, bismuth undergoes a structural phase transition to a higher symmetry state, whereas at approximately 2% excitation the barrier between the wells is lowered sufficiently for the atoms to move in both wells (19). It is unclear, for an initial room temperature lattice, whether this level of excitation density can be achieved without subsequent thermal melting of the material (or what role formation of domains plays in the melting transition). At these excitation levels there is no evidence, either experimentally or in the DFT results, of a nonthermal melting transition such as that found in tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors (20-24). In addition to the quasi-equilibrium coordinate, we extract the carrier density-dependent curvature of the potential well from the measured frequency of the A1g mode, assuming a harmonic potential (solid black curves in Fig. 3). The extent of the curves represents the maximum range of motion of the ions that occurs in the limit of a purely displacive excitation. A comparison of these results with the potential calculated by DFT (dotted lines, corresponding to fixed-density cross sections of the surface shown in Fig. 2) shows that for carrier densities as high as 1%, the atoms are well described as moving in a purely harmonic potential. At the highest carrier density in which we could extract a phonon frequency from the data, the calculations predict only a slight deviation from a harmonic potential. This result is reinforced by the excellent agreement between the measured and calculated frequency (which includes the anharmonic terms) as a function of carrier density (Fig. 3, inset). Thus, although anharmonicity must be present at some level, electronic softening by far dominates the determination of the phonon frequency at the high excitation densities in this and former experiments.

The inset displays the phonon frequency as a function of carrier density. The dotted line shows A1g frequencies from DFT frozen phonon calculations. The starred point is the equilibrium Raman value of the A1g frequency. Two important technical advances enabled these experiments: the generation of high x-ray photon flux in a temporally short pulse from a linear accelerator source and the ability to measure the relative x-ray and laser pulse arrival times. Standard stroboscopic measurements in the subpicosecond time regime derive the excitation pulse and probe pulse from the same ultrafast source with the pumpprobe relative delay determined by the optical path length difference. This setup ensures synchronization between pump and probe and realizes the temporal limit set by the probe pulse duration. In experiments in which the pump and probe are derived from separate sources, such as the study reported here, synchronization is not inherent and must be actively attained. To achieve temporal resolution of the order of x-ray pulse duration, it is necessary to either synchronize the two sources to a fraction of the probe pulse duration or to measure the relative arrival time on a shot-by-shot basis. As a result of sources of jitter in the linear electron accelerator that cannot be mitigated, particularly electron bunch energy fluctuations, synchronization to the level of the x-ray pulse duration is not achievable and a relative time-of-arrival measurement is essential for experiments that require multishot data acquisition. Temporal resolution of 1/2100 fs, required to observe coherent phonon motion in bismuth, was achieved by measuring the relative arrival time of the electron bunches using electro-optic sampling (EOS) (2). Laser pulses, split from the same source used to photoexcite the bismuth film, were transported by optical fiber to the electron beam (25). The measured electro-optic signal from the electron bunch was as short as 170 fs FWHM, and the centroid of this feature was determined to sub-20 fs precision and used as a time stamp for the relative time of arrival. The temporal jitter between the pump and the probe provided random sampling of time points. X-ray data obtained from diffraction measurements were sorted into 40-fs time bins according to the time of arrival measured through EOS (Fig. 4). Data within a time bin were averaged together to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The results of these experiments demonstrate the type of data collection techniques and timing diagnostic that will be instrumental to maximize the scientific capabilities of the next generation of x-ray light sources.

Abstract The 1918 influenza pandemic was a catastrophic series of virus outbreaks that spread across the globe. Here, we show that only a modest change in the 1918 influenza hemagglutinin receptor binding site alters the transmissibility of this pandemic virus. Two amino acid mutations that cause a switch in receptor binding preference from the human -2,6 to the avian -2,3 sialic acid resulted in a virus incapable of respiratory droplet transmission between ferrets but that maintained its lethality and replication efficiency in the upper respiratory tract. Furthermore, poor transmission of a 1918 virus with dual -2,6 and -2,3 specificity suggests that a predominant human -2,6 sialic acid binding preference is essential for optimal transmission of this pandemic virus. These findings confirm an essential role of hemagglutinin receptor specificity for the transmission of influenza viruses among mammals. The "Spanish" influenza pandemic virus spread globally and resulted in the deaths of up to 50 million people worldwide (1, 2). The ability of this H1N1 pandemic strain to spread rapidly and cause high rates of illness among humans makes it valuable for studying the molecular properties that confer efficient transmissibility of influenza viruses. An influenza virus bearing all eight gene segments of the 1918 pandemic virus was recently generated in cultured cells, was found to be lethal for chicken embryos and mice, and displayed a high-growth phenotype in human lung cells. Furthermore, the 1918 hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase genes were shown to be essential for maximal virus replication and optimal virulence (3-5). Influenza pandemics seem to occur every 10 to 40 years, but the factors that lead to the emergence of pandemic viruses are complex and poorly understood. However, the establishment of efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission of a virus to which humans have little or no preexisting immunity is a fundamental property of pandemic strains (6, 7). Most threatening is the possibility of another pandemic, similar to that experienced in 1918, caused by a novel influenza subtype virus capable of causing severe respiratory disease and death. The avian influenza H5N1 virus, which has resulted in more than 250 human infections (8), has not acquired human influenza virus genes and lacks the ability to spread efficiently from human to human (9, 10). Reassortment of avian H5N1 virus genes with human H3N2 influenza virus genes was shown to be insufficient for transmission of this avian virus (11), suggesting that additional unknown mutations are required for H5N1 to emerge as a pandemic strain. The binding of influenza viruses to their target cells is mediated by the viral HA, which recognizes cell surface glycoconjugates containing terminal sialic acid (SA) residues. Avian influenza viruses preferentially bind SA linked to galactose by an -2,3 linkage (2,3 SA), which is found in high concentrations on the epithelial cells of the intestine of waterfowl and shorebirds (12). Conversely, human influenza viruses (H1 to H3 subtypes) more readily bind to receptors that contain terminal -2,6-linked sialyl-galactosyl (2,6 SA) moieties that are found on the human respiratory tract epithelium (13, 14). The three influenza pandemic viruses of the last century, occurring in 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2), each possessed an HA with a human 2,6 SA binding preference and are thought to have originated from an avian virus possessing the 2,3 SA binding preference (13-16). It has been postulated that the lack of sustained human-to-human transmission of avian influenza H5N1 viruses is due to their 2,3 SA receptor binding preference (17-19). Higher proportions of 2,3 SA receptors in the human lower respiratory tract compared with the upper respiratory tract may explain the severity of H5N1 viral pneumonia in humans resulting from H5N1 viral attachment deep in the lungs (17, 19). Amino acids at positions 190 and 225 in the 1918 pandemic influenza virus HA determine its receptor binding specificity (15, 16). In this study, we generated recombinant influenza viruses possessing all eight gene segments of the 1918 influenza virus to examine the role of receptor binding specificity on replication, pathogenicity, and transmissibility of this pandemic strain. We generated two variant A/South Carolina/1/18 (SC18) 1918 viruses in which the HA was altered to change the receptor binding specificity from the parental human 2,6 SA (SC18) receptor preference to an avian 2,3 SA receptor preference (AV18) or a mixed 2,6 and 2,3 SA specificity reflecting the A/New York/1/18 (NY18) virus binding specificity. The NY18 virus was a natural variant sequenced from an archived lung tissue sample prepared during autopsy of a patient who died within 6 days of hospitalization in September 1918 (20). The HA corresponding to NY18 virus was made by introducing a single amino acid substitution [Asp225Gly225 (D225G)] in the SC18 HA. The AV18 virus, which differs by one amino acid from NY18 virus, was made by introducing an additional amino acid change [Asp190Glu190 (D190E)] within the NY18 HA. Compared with the SC18 virus, the AV18 variant has two amino acid changes (D190E and D225G) in the HA, which matches the conserved avian consensus sequence in the receptor binding site and which converts it to the classic 2,3 SA receptor preference (15). A/Duck/Alberta/35/76 (Dk/Alb) and A/Texas/36/91 (Tx/91) viruses were included in the study as controls representative of an avian H1N1 virus and a human H1N1 virus, respectively. The 1918 viruses were generated by using the previously described reverse genetics system (21-23), and the identities of virus genes in the rescued viruses were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis. The rescued 1918 viruses containing the parental SC18 HA and the two variant HAs had similarly high infectivity titers in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Table 1). The receptor-binding properties of the 1918 viruses were confirmed in HA assays by using enzymatically modified chicken red blood cells (CRBCs) that contain either 2,3 or 2,6 SA, as previously described (15). The AV18 virus and the avian Dk/Alb control virus hemagglutinated the 2,3-resialylated CRBCs only, whereas the SC18 virus hemagglutinated the 2,6-resialylated CRBCs only. The NY18 virus hemagglutinated both 2,3- and 2,6-resialylated CRBCs. Table 1.

Similar results were obtained when viruses were adjusted to 8, 16, or 32 hemagglutination units with untreated CRBCs.

Ferrets were housed in adjacent cages that prevented direct and indirect contact between animals but allowed spread of influenza virus through the air (11, 25). They were inoculated intranasally with 106 PFU (plaque forming units). One day after infection, three naive ferrets housed in transmission cages were placed adjacent to each of the three inoculated ferrets (26). Three additional inoculated ferrets from each virus-infected group were killed on day 3 postinoculation (p.i.) for assessment of pathologic and virologic parameters (26). Ferrets inoculated with the parental SC18 virus shed high titers of infectious virus in nasal washes beginning as early as day 1 p.i. [50% egg infectious dose (EID50/ml) from 106.25 to 107.25], and they sustained titers of 104.5 EID50/ml for 9 days p.i. (Fig. 1A, left). SC18 virus caused severe disease in all inoculated ferrets starting 2 days p.i.; symptoms included lethargy, anorexia, rhinorrhea, sneezing, severe weight loss (Table 2 and fig S1), and high fever, and two of the three animals died by day 11 p.i. Ferrets inoculated with H1N1 Tx/91 and Dk/Alb also shed high titers of virus in nasal washes (peak titers had EID50/ml values from 105.5 to 106.8), but they were able to clear the virus from the upper respiratory tract by day 9 p.i. (Fig. 1, B and C) after displaying minimal symptoms (Table 2). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

The SC18 virus was detected in the contact ferrets as early as day 1 postcontact (p.c.), whereas the Tx/91 virus required 3 to 5 days to achieve detectable virus titers in nasal washes of the Tx/91 contact ferrets. The Tx/91 contact ferrets exhibited little morbidity, whereas all three SC18 contact ferrets exhibited severe signs of illness and weight loss, and one of three contact animals failed to clear the virus before it succumbed to infection on day 6 p.c. In contrast to the efficient spread of SC18 and Tx/91 viruses, the avian Dk/Alb virus was not transmitted to naive contact ferrets, because virus was not detected in the nasal washes from the contact ferrets at any time. Furthermore, seroconversion was not detected by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) analysis of postexposure sera (Table 2). Both A/Duck/New York/15024/96 and A/Turkey/South Dakota/7034/86, which are representative avian viruses with an 2,3 SA receptor preference, exhibited efficient replication in the upper respiratory tract, but no transmission was detected between ferrets. We introduced one- and two-amino acid substitutions into the 1918 virus HA to produce SC18 variants NY18 and AV18, respectively. A switch in receptor specificity from an 2,6 SA (human) to an 2,3 SA (avian) binding preference abolished the transmissibility of the pandemic virus (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Although ferrets inoculated with AV18 virus exhibited severe illness (Table 2 and fig S1) and shed high titers of infectious virus in nasal washes (Fig. 2A, left), none of the three AV18 contact ferrets had detectable virus in nasal washes, and postexposure sera collected from contact animals lacked antibodies against AV18. The NY18 virus, with dual 2,6 and 2,3 SA specificity, also resulted in severe illness and death among the inoculated ferrets, but it failed to transmit efficiently, as evidenced by the paucity of clinical symptoms and virus shedding among the contact ferrets (Fig. 2B). Two of the three NY18 contact ferrets seroconverted with relatively low HI titers of 40 and 80 (Table 2). The lack of efficient transmission was not due to the inability of the NY18 virus to replicate to high titers in the upper respiratory tract, including the nasal turbinates (Fig. 2B, left, and fig S2). Interestingly, no sneezing was noted among the AV18- and NY18-inoculated ferrets through a 14-day observation period, a finding consistent with the lack of notable sneezing observed in ferrets infected with H5N1 viruses (11).

Receptor binding, the initial event in influenza virus infection, was a major determinant of virus transmission efficiency of the H1N1 pandemic virus. This work also evaluates the virulence of the 1918 virus in a ferret model, a model that is believed to be more representative than the mouse model of disease caused by influenza viruses in humans. In contrast to other human influenza virus strains, the 1918 virus demonstrated uniquely high virulence and lethality in ferrets. The mutant 1918 virus possessing 2,3 SA receptor binding (AV18) was equally virulent in ferrets as the parental SC18 strain at the dose administered. Remarkably, the AV18 virus replicated in the upper respiratory tract as efficiently as the parental SC18 virus, but it failed to transmit to contact ferrets. Moreover, a human 2,6 SA binding preference is essential for optimal transmission of this exceptionally virulent virus. The introduction of a single mutation that converts the HA to dual 2,6 and 2,3 SA binding specificity (NY18) reduced the high transmissibility observed with the parental 1918 (SC18) virus. This result is consistent with the previously demonstrated lack of transmissibility of an H5N1 2003 virus that possessed dual 2,6 and 2,3 SA specificity due to a naturally acquired mutation at HA residue 223 (H5 numbering; residue 227 by H3 numbering) (11, 27). Our findings raise the possibility that, to become more transmissible, the currently circulating avian influenza H5N1 virus may require a receptor binding change to a predominant 2,6 SA binding preference. Such a modification of H5 HA may result in improved virus binding to human tracheal epithelial cells expressing high amounts of terminal 2,6 SA motifs and, simultaneously, in an improved ability to overcome the inhibitory effects of human bronchial mucins associated with 2,3 SA receptors (28). However, mutations that caused a shift from the avian-type to human-type receptor binding specificity for the H1 subtype do not cause an equivalent shift in specificity for the H5 subtype (24). Likewise, the amino acid changes required to alter the H3 HA from an avian- to human-type receptor binding specificity are different from those required for the H1 HA. Therefore, it is likely that different avian HA subtypes have different structural requirements to confer receptor specificity. Thus, it is currently unknown which additional mutations in the H5 HAwould cause a shift to the human-type specificity, which may be required for H5N1 viruses to transmit efficiently among humans.
Abstract We show that composite materials can exhibit a viscoelastic modulus (Young's modulus) that is far greater than that of either constituent. The modulus, but not the strength, of the composite was observed to be substantially greater than that of diamond. These composites contain bariumtitanate inclusions, which undergo a volume-change phase transformation if they are not constrained. In the composite, the inclusions are partially constrained by the surrounding metal matrix. The constraint stabilizes the negative bulk modulus (inverse compressibility) of the inclusions. This negative modulus arises from stored elastic energy in the inclusions, in contrast to periodic composite metamaterials that exhibit negative refraction by inertial resonant effects. Conventional composites with positive-stiffness constituents have aggregate properties bounded by a weighted average of constituent properties; their modulus cannot exceed that of the stiffest constituent. In most elastic systems, a deformed object experiences a force with a component in the same direction as the deformation, so that the stiffness is positive. Negative structural stiffness (i.e., force/displacement ratio) can occur in pre-strained objects such as tubes buckled to form kinks, which contain stored energy at equilibrium (1). Experimentally, negative structural stiffness has been observed in lumped buckled systems composed of rubber tubes (2) and models of single foam cells (3). The elastic modulus, a stress/strain ratio, is a measure of material stiffness. A negative modulus is anticipated in the context of Landau's (4) theory of phase transformation. As the temperature T is lowered from a value above the transformation temperature, an energy function of both strain mu and temperature (Fig. 1) with a single minimum gradually flattens, then develops two minima or potential wells. If the strain is a shear strain, the transformation is martensitic; for a hydrostatic strain, it is a volume-change transformation. The curvature of this energy function represents an elastic modulus, so that the flattening of the curve corresponds to a softening of the modulus near a critical temperature Tc, a phenomenon observed experimentally. Below Tc, the reversed curvature at a small strain represents a negative modulus. A negative modulus, in which the force that deforms an object is in the direction opposite to the displacement, is distinct from a negative Poisson's ratio, in which a material expands laterally when it is stretched (5-7). A negative modulus may occur in a pre-deformed object; it is then a negative incremental modulus. An object with all free surfaces and a negative modulus is unstable. A negative shear modulus causes bands or domains to form, even if the surfaces are constrained. A solid object with a negative bulk modulus (inverse compressibility) can be stabilized by a constraint of the surfaces (8), in contrast to fluids (9). Negative incremental compressibility has been observed in small-cell foams (10). Negative compressibility differs from negative thermal expansion (11), which is the stable contraction of an unconstrained object because of a temperature increase.

Negative stiffness can give rise to extreme values of physical properties in heterogeneous systems. For example, both negative stiffness and the resulting giant damping were observed (2) in a lumped system containing discrete buckled tubes. A composite with negative-stiffness inclusions is predicted to give rise to material properties greater than those of either constituent (12, 13). Such behavior exceeds classical bounds (14), in which composite properties cannot exceed the properties of the constituents. These bounds are theorems assuming that each constituent initially contains no stored energy. Negative stiffness entails initial stored energy; viscoelastic dissipation, if present, enhances composite stability. In composites (15), anomalous high viscoelastic damping was observed and attributed to a negative shear modulus in ferroelastic inclusions that were partially constrained by the matrix. These inclusions were sufficiently small that some of them were single domains. Similar composites (16) of higher concentration exhibited instability, as predicted by a composite theory incorporating a negative shear modulus. Composite materials were prepared with inclusions of barium titanate (BaTiO3) in a tin matrix. BaTiO3 was used because it is a ferroelastic, and also a ferroelectric, solid that exhibits a crystal volume change and a crystal shape change during phase transformations, specifically cubic-to-tetragonal transformations at Tc near 120C and tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transformations near 5C. The rationale for considering this class of phase transformation is that we can have a negative bulk modulus K in a constrained inclusion and yet still have stability. Constraint by the matrix restrains the transformation over a range of temperatures. Inclusions were, by design, sufficiently large to contain many domains below Tc. The bulk modulus of a material affects its stiffness in bending but not in torsion, because bending entails a local volume change. Polycrystalline BaTiO3 was fragmented and sieved to achieve a particle-size distribution between 210 and 150 1/2m. Domains in such materials can be smaller than 1 1/2m. Some particles were plated with nickel to improve their interface quality. Composites were fabricated using plated or unplated particles of the same pre-plated sizes. Dispersion of particle inclusions was achieved through an ultrasonic casting technique (17). Specimens (18) were sectioned from ingots, by means of a low-speed diamond saw, into rectangular cross sections, typically 2 mm * 2 mm * 3.5 cm, or they were cut into cylinders with diameters of 2.6 mm and lengths of 3 cm, by means of a wire electric-discharge milling machine. Digital optical micrographs of polished composite specimens were taken. Specimens were tested in bending by means of broadband viscoelastic spectroscopy (19). This instrument, which is capable of isothermal internal friction studies over 11 orders of magnitude in frequency, was modified to allow operation up to 300C and to detect spontaneous strain exceeding 10-4. The viscoelastic response was measured at 100 Hz in bending, which is well below any natural frequency. Torque was applied electromagnetically, and deformation was measured by a laser method. Temperature was monitored with a thermocouple in the air flow within 1 mm of the specimen, so as to avoid interference with viscoelastic measurement. Heating and cooling rates were 0.05 to 0.5C/s. The procedure is typical of viscoelastic studies of materials, including those that undergo transformation. Of the 13 specimens with plated inclusions, all exhibited an anomalous viscoelastic response in bending. An anomalous response is defined as a change in modulus or damping that is larger than could be accounted for by composite theory (20), assuming a positive inclusion modulus of any value between zero and infinity. Three specimens exhibited large anomalies and three exhibited a Young's modulus (|E*|, absolute value of the complex viscoelastic modulus) greater than that of diamond. Because all materials exhibit some damping, any measured modulus is a viscoelastic modulus. Of the 15 specimens with unplated inclusions, 11 exhibited an anomalous response, and 1 exhibited a Young's modulus greater than that of diamond. It is theorized that the degree of the anomalous response depends on the quality of the inclusion/matrix interface. No anomalous behavior was observed in torsion. The microstructure of a specimen from the latter series, with inclusions measuring 10% by volume, is shown in Fig. 2. Modulus and damping (tan , with representing the phase between stress and strain) of this specimen are shown in Fig. 3. Given the modest damping, the magnitude of the modulus |E*| exceeds the real part E' by only about 2%. Young's modulus exceeds that of diamond over a narrow range of temperatures. Transient negative viscoelastic damping (tan ) indicates the release of stored energy from the inclusions. Although they are stiff, these materials are not expected to be unusually strong or hard. Negative specific heat was observed in those specimens that exhibited the largest mechanical effects (18). This behavior is consistent with the negative bulk moduli of the inclusions because the theoretical specific heat depends on the constituent bulk moduli (21).

Young's modulus |E*| and viscoelastic damping tan of the composite in Fig. 2, showing extremely high modulus over a range of temperatures. is the phase angle between stress and strain. Young's moduli of the constituents are BaTiO3, 100 GPa; and tin, 50 GPa. Error bars (4%, smaller than data points) in the low-modulus regime are dominated by irregularity in the specimen diameter and in the high-modulus regime are dominated by digital resolution of the lock-in amplifier. Errors in tan , 1/20.001, are smaller than the data points. The behavior of all composites changed with thermal cycling, as was also observed in composites (16) with VO2 inclusions; peaks tended to shift to higher temperatures and to attenuate with cycling. Composites with plated inclusions maintained their behavior over a greater number of cycles than did materials in which the inclusions were not plated. The inclusion/matrix interface is therefore clearly important in determining the behavior of the composites. Extreme elastic anomalies were observed for as many as five cycles in a particular specimen. Composite analysis (13) shows that macroscopic strain can be magnified locally by several orders of magnitude in the vicinity of the inclusions during the phase transformation. The macroscopic strain amplitude (less than 4 * 10-6 in these experiments) can therefore give rise to a local strain that is sufficient to cause yield in the tin matrix. This amplified local strain can account for the cycle dependence that could be ameliorated by using a stronger matrix. Broad peaks in damping (tan ) were also observed, as shown in Fig. 4. Even modest effects in these composites are notable because for a dilute particulate morphology, composite properties are known (14, 20) to be relatively insensitive to inclusion properties when they have a positive modulus. For example, with a 10% concentration of particles, the composite modulus |E*| due to infinitely stiff inclusions is predicted to increase by 22% as compared with that of the pure matrix. The composite damping due to inclusions with a peak damping tan = 0.06, corresponding to bulk BaTiO3, is predicted to be only 6% greater than that of the matrix. The damping peaks shown in Fig. 4 (8% inclusion concentration) correspond to a factor of 2 increase as compared with pure tin (also shown), so, as with the above giant anomalies in the modulus, negative compressibility of the inclusions is inferred.

E0 is the normalizing modulus, which has a value of 30 GPa. The present extreme-stiffness results are based on negative compressibility (inverse bulk modulus K, resistance to volume change) of inclusions, in contrast to the negative shear modulus G (resistance to shape change) in earlier Sn-VO2 composites (15) that exhibited large damping but modest (5%) anomalies in the modulus. These three-dimensional aspects of deformation govern the stability and properties of materials. Positive values of G and K give rise to a positive-definite strain energy and hence to the stability of an object with free surfaces and no constraint. This corresponds to the usual allowable range of Poisson's ratio 1/4, -11/4 0 and -4G/3 . A strongly elliptic solid constrained at the surface is incrementally stable (22) and has a unique elasticity solution (23), so a range of negative bulk modulus is allowed. A material with negative shear modulus G is unstable with respect to domain formation. Surface energy limits how small a domain can be, so a sufficiently small crystal can be a single domain and can operate as a negative-stiffness inclusion, as was the case in Sn-VO2 composites. There is no such inclusion size limitation associated with a negative bulk modulus. An inclusion in a composite is under partial constraint. Diamond has long been considered to have maximal properties such as stiffness and hardness. The achievement of substantially greater stiffness illustrates the importance of composites with negative-stiffness inclusions. These composites have potential in high-performance materials in which high stiffness or high dissipation are of use. They may occur naturally in rocks and play a role in deep-focus earthquakes.
AbstractType Ia supernovae, the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars composed of carbon and oxygen, were instrumental as distance indicators in establishing the acceleration of the universe's expansion. However, the physics of the explosion are debated. Here we report a systematic spectral analysis of a large sample of well-observed type Ia supernovae. Mapping the velocity distribution of the main products of nuclear burning, we constrain theoretical scenarios. We find that all supernovae have low-velocity cores of stable iron-group elements. Outside this core, nickel-56 dominates the supernova ejecta. The outer extent of the iron-group material depends on the amount of nickel-56 and coincides with the inner extent of silicon, the principal product of incomplete burning. The outer extent of the bulk of silicon is similar in all supernovae, having an expansion velocity of 1/211,000 kilometers per second and corresponding to a mass of slightly over one solar mass. This indicates that all the supernovae considered here burned similar masses and suggests that their progenitors had the same mass. Synthetic light-curve parameters and three-dimensional explosion simulations support this interpretation. A single explosion scenario, possibly a delayed detonation, may thus explain most type Ia supernovae.When a white dwarf (WD) composed of carbon and oxygen, accreting mass from a companion star in a binary system, approaches the Chandrasekhar mass [MCh 1.38 solar masses (M)], high temperature causes the ignition of explosive nuclear burning reactions that process stellar material and produce energy. The star explodes, leaving no remnant, producing a type Ia supernova (SNIa) (1). At high stellar material densities, burning yields nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) isotopes, in particular radioactive 56Ni, which decays to 56Co and 56Fe, making the SN bright (2). At lower densities, intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) are synthesized. Both groups of elements are observed in the optical spectra of type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) (3). An empirical relation between an observed quantity, the blue (B)-magnitude decline over the first 15 days after maximum luminosity [m15 (B)], and a physical quantity, the SN maximum luminosity (4), can be used to determine the distance to a SNIa. This method was applied to very distant SNeIa, leading to the discovery of the accelerating universe (5, 6). How the explosion actually proceeds is, however, debated (7-9), as is the nature of the progenitor system: Accretion may occur either from a more massive companion (such as a giant) or via the merging of two carbon-oxygen WDs (10). This casts a shadow on the reliability of SNeIa as distance indicators, because intrinsically very different explosions may result in the observed correlation.We derived the distribution of the principal elements in 23 nearby SNeIa (distances 1300 km s-1.A few SNe, defined as high-velocity-gradient (HVG) SNe (11), are responsible for most of the dispersion. They have a rapidly decreasing v(Si) before maximum and very-high-velocity CaII lines, possibly the result of high-velocity blobs that carry little mass and kinetic energy but cause high-velocity absorption features (HVFs) (12) that can abnormally broaden the SiII line profile (12, 13). Although excluding them from the sample decreases the dispersion in v(Si) significantly [v(Si) = 11,300 650 km s-1], we include all of these SNe in our discussion.The maximum Si velocity thus measured is a conservative estimate. The deep absorption core is produced in layers of high Si abundance. Si is present at higher velocities, indicated by the wavelength of bluest absorption in the earliest spectrum of each SN. However, measuring the bluest absorption velocity yields a large scatter because the earliest spectra have different epochs and may be affected by HVFs (12). Our method reliably determines the outer location of the bulk of IMEs.The inner extent of Si, determined from the asymptotic velocity of the SiII 6355 A line in postmaximum spectra [fig. 1 in (11)], is a steep function of m15 (B). The brightest (slowest-declining) SNe have the thinnest Si zones.The inner ejecta, dominated by NSE elements, are best observed 1/21 year after the explosion, when dilution caused by expansion makes the SN behave like a nebula, exposing the deepest layers. Collisions with the fast particles produced by the decay of 56Ni 56Co56Fe heat the gas, which cools, emitting radiation mostly in forbidden lines.We modeled the nebular spectra using a code that computes line emission, balancing heating and cooling in nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) (14), including density and abundance stratification. We adopted the density-velocity distribution of the standard, one-dimensional, MCh explosion model W7 (1) (fig. S1). In the nebular phase, the gas is transparent, and line emissivity depends on the mass of the emitting ion. Accurately estimating this mass requires determining the ionization state of the gas. Forbidden lines of FeII and FeIII dominate SNIa nebular spectra, reflecting the high abundance of NSE material. Fe is mostly the product of 56Ni decay, which provides heating. The stable, neutron-rich isotopes 54Fe and 58Ni do not contribute to heating but do contribute to cooling, because they also emit forbidden lines. Their presence affects the ionization balance. Both are mostly produced deep in the WD, at the highest densities. The 54Fe nebular lines have wavelengths indistinguishable from those of 56Fe.We determined the mass and distribution in velocity of the Fe isotopes (and thus of 56Ni), simultaneously fitting the ratio of the two strongest Fe emissions (fig. S1). One, near 4700 A, includes both FeII and FeIII lines, whereas the other, near 5200 A, is only due to FeII. A low upper limit to the mass of 58Ni is set by the absence of strong emission lines (in particular at 7380 A).In the deepest layers (Fig. 1), all SNe contain 1/20.1 to 0.3 M of stable NSE isotopes, with a large scatter and no dependence on m15 (B) [see also (15)].

The enclosed mass (linked to velocity via the W7 explosion model) of different burning products is shown versus declinerate parameter m15 (B) (aproxy for SN luminosity). Individual SNe are colored according to their velocity evolution (11): HVG, blue; low velocity gradient (LVG), green; and faint, red. Open circles indicate the mass of stable 54Fe + 58Ni for each SN, solid circles indicate that of 56Ni, and open triangles indicate the sum of these (total NSE mass). Crosses show the sum of NSE and IME mass, indicating the total mass burned. The IME mass is the difference between crosses and triangles. 54Fe and 58Ni are found in roughly constant amounts in the deepest parts of all SNe, irrespective of luminosity: M(stable NSE) = 0.20 0.05 M (lower horizontal shaded area). The 56Ni mass determines the SN luminosity. It correlates with m15 (B): M(56Ni) = 1.34 - 0.67m15 (B) [M], with rms dispersion 0.13 M (lower diagonal shaded area). The total NSE mass correlates with m15 (B) better than M(56Ni): M(NSE) = 1.55 - 0.69m15 (B)[M], rms dispersion 0.09 M (upper diagonal shaded area). IMEs lie mostly outside the iron-group zone. The outer Si velocity is similar for all SNe except HVG SNe. The mass enclosed by IMEs represents the total burned mass. When all SNe are included, the average value is 1/21.05 0.09 M (upper horizontal shaded area). Excluding HVG SNe, the value is 1/21.01 0.05 M (horizontal line). Both values are independent of m15 (B). For a version of this plot with SN names and a bar diagram, see figs. S2 and S3. As expected, the 56Ni mass correlates inversely with m15 (B), ranging from 0.9 M for the slowest-declining (most luminous) SNe to 0.1 M for the fastest-declining (dimmest) ones. The root mean square (rms) dispersion is 0.13 M, but SNe with intermediate decline rates [m15 (B) 1/21.05 to 1.5 magnitudes] show variations of almost a factor of 2 for the same value of m15 (B). These SNe could cause scatter about the mean luminosity-decline-rate relation (16).Once the contributions of 56Ni, 54Fe, and 58Ni are added together to evaluate the total NSE mass, the dispersion decreases to 0.09 M. If SNe with different amounts of 56Ni, and thus presumably different temperatures, but similar NSE content have similar m15 (B), it is likely that abundances (17) rather than temperature (18) primarily determine the opacity and light-curve shape.The outer velocity of the NSE region, determined from the width of the Fe lines, correlates with SN luminosity (19). It coincides with the innermost Si velocity, marking the transition from complete to incomplete burning: The difference between these two velocities, (v) = 650 900 km s-1, is consistent with zero. This results from two different methods applied to data obtained almost 1 year apart.Thus, whereas the mass of 56Ni, and consequently the SN luminosity, can differ significantly, other characteristics of SNeIa are remarkably homogeneous. In particular, the narrow dispersion of the outer Si velocity indicates a similar extent of thermonuclear burning in all SNeIa: SNe that produce less 56Ni synthesize more IMEs.The simplest interpretation of these seemingly antithetical results is that thermonuclear burning consumes similar masses in all SNeIa. We explore whether this scenario is consistent with the MCh model (10). Applying the densityvelocity structure of model W7 (1), we transform v(Si) to mass (Fig. 1). We find that the outer shell of Si encloses a mass of at least 1/21.05 0.09 M (1/21.01 0.05 M, excluding HVG SNe), independently of m15 (B). This is a lower limit to the burned mass.The light-curve width is related to m15 (B) (20) and depends on the ejected mass Mej, the kinetic energy Ek, and the opacity as (21). We tested our assumption by computing parametrized light-curve widths and comparing them to observed values. The resulting luminosity-decline-rate relation (Fig. 2) is very tight and practically identical to the observed one. This result supports our opacity parametrization, corroborating our hypothesis that the mass burned is similar in all SNeIa. Given its weak dependence on Ek, the light-curve width is not much affected if more of the outer part of the WD is burned to IMEs, as these do not contribute much to the opacity.

Colors indicate velocity evolution as in Fig. 1. The peak luminosity L was computed from M(56Ni) as L = 2 * 1043M(56Ni) (28). Observed bolometric light-curve (LC) widths were obtained from observed rise and decline times (29) as T = (t- 1/2 + t+1/2). When t- 1/2 is missing, it was estimated from the relation between t- 1/2 and m15 (B) derived from the other SNe. The dashed line is a linear regression between luminosity and observed LC width for the seven SNe common to our sample and that of (29). Synthetic bolometric LC widths were obtained assuming that: (i) The LC width depends on ejected mass Mej, kinetic energy Ek, and opacity as (21). (ii) For all SNe, Mej = MCh. The W7 (1) density-velocity distribution was used. (iii) The explosion kinetic energy depends on the burning product: Ek = [1.56 M(56Ni) + 1.74 M(stable NSE) + 1.24 M(IME) - 0.46] * 1051 erg (17). (iv) Opacity is mostly due to line absorption (30). Accordingly, NSE elements contribute much more than IMEs, because their atomic level structure is more complex. The opacity was therefore parametrized according to the abundances of different species: M(NSE) + 0.1 M(IME) (16). To compare the parametrized LC widths to observed values T, a scale factor x = T/ was computed for each of the seven SNe common to our sample and that of (29). The average factor, x = 24.447, was used to scale all SNe. Dots show the individual SNe. The continuous line is the linear regression between luminosity and synthetic LC width for our sample of 23 SNeIa. For a version of this plot with SN names, see fig. S4. If SNeIa burn a similar mass, the progenitor mass is also likely to be the same, namely MCh. Because the outcome of the burning depends essentially on fuel density, a variation in iron-group elements production in MCh WDs requires different WD expansion histories. This in turn depends on the details of the burning. Once the WD reaches MCh, a thermonuclear flame is ignited near the center. The flame must start as a subsonic deflagration (21), mediated by microphysical transport and accelerated by turbulence. As it propagates outwards, it could undergo a deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) and continue as a shock-driven supersonic detonation wave, in a so-called delayed detonation (22). This constitutes the most extreme explosion scenario admissible, exploring the limits of MCh explosions.We modeled the explosion using a three-dimensional level-set approach (23). The ignition of the deflagration flame was treated as a stochastic process generating a number of ignition spots placed randomly and isotropically within 180 km of the WD center (24).What would cause the DDT is unclear. We assumed that it occurs as turbulence penetrates the internal flame structure: the onset of the so-called distributed burning regime (25). This happens at low fuel densities, after some WD pre-expansion in the deflagration phase. The detonation is triggered artificially where the chosen DDT criterion is first satisfied, typically near the outer edges of the deflagration structure (Table 1 shows DDT parameters). Table 1. Results and DDT parameters of parametrized three-dimensional delayed detonation models.Model M(NSE) (M)M(IME) (M)tDDT (s)DDT (107 cm-3) D800 1.004 0.638 0.547 0.675 2.40 D20 1.237 0.833 0.435 0.724 1.92 D5 1.524 1.141 0.220 0.731 1.33 Three simulations, with 800, 20, and 5 ignition spots, termed D800, D20, and D5, respectively, were performed on a moving cellular Cartesian grid (26) comprising the full star. Model D800, with its dense distribution of ignition points, exhausts the carbon-oxygen fuel at the WD center almost completely in the deflagration phase. The energy release quickly expands the star, and the subsequent detonation mainly transforms low-density outer material to IMEs. In contrast, the few ignition spots of model D5 consume little material during the deflagration, leaving more fuel at high densities, which is converted mostly to NSE isotopes in the vigorous detonation phase. Model D20 provides an intermediate case.The ejecta compositions of the model explosions agree grossly with the results derived from the spectra. The NSE mass produced ranges from 0.638 to 1.141 M. The weakest explosions result from optimal burning in the deflagration phase (26), and subluminous SNeIa are not reached in our parametrization. However, the conditions for DDT need further investigation. Eventually these events may be explained within a single framework. Some extremely luminous SNeIa may come from very rapidly rotating WDs whose mass exceeds MCh (27), but these are rare.The distribution derived from observations of burning products inside SNeIa could result from the variation of a single initial parameter, the flame ignition configuration, in MCh delayed detonations. The luminosity-decline-rate relation can be reproduced using this distribution and a simple opacity parametrization. Our results support the MCh scenario for most SNeIa, adding confidence to their use as distance indicators.
AbstractDroplets of one liquid suspended in a second, immiscible liquid move through a microfluidic device in which a channel splits into two branches that reconnect downstream. The droplets choose a path based on the number of droplets that occupy each branch. The interaction among droplets in the channels results in complex sequences of path selection. The linearity of the flow through the microchannels, however, ensures that the behavior of the system can be reversed. This reversibility makes it possible to encrypt and decrypt signals coded in the intervals between droplets. The encoding/decoding device is a functional microfluidic system that requires droplets to navigate a network in a precise manner without the use of valves, switches, or other means of external control.The use of microfluidic devices provides a means to study both nonlinear (periodic and chaotic) and reversible behaviors of flows of fluids, although no microfluidic system has simultaneously demonstrated both of these classes of dynamics. At low Reynolds number (Re), the behavior of fluids typically can be reversed-as if the system were going backward in time-by reversing the direction of the forces applied to the system. Recent work has detailed microfluidic systems, which demonstrate nonlinear behaviors such as periodic or chaotic dynamics, that are either inherently irreversible or have not been demonstrated to be reversible (1-3). Here, we describe a microfluidic device that displays reversible nonlinear dynamics. In this system, droplets of water-based ink moving in hexadecane arrive at a T intersection, where they select one of two paths that form a loop by reconnecting downstream. The binary choices that the droplets make cause the resistance to flow through each branch to evolve in time in a nonlinear fashion: that is, the droplets in each branch influence the choice of subsequent droplets between branches by modifying the rates of flow of liquid through the channels. This behavior results in nonlinear dynamics-droplets select paths with controllable periodicity, and in some instances they choose paths in an aperiodic fashion-whereas the characteristically linear flow of both liquids through the microchannels allows the dynamics to be reversible. We believe that this system can serve as a platform for studying the transition in nonlinear systems from reversible to irreversible dynamics. The reversible, nonlinear dynamics that the device demonstrates are also useful for "lab-on-a-chip" applications-systems that perform physical, chemical, or biological functions on millimeter- to centimeter-scale platforms. For example, we used the device to process a signal represented by sequences of droplets-by encoding and then decoding it-using only the pressure-driven flow of liquids.Flows at the small length scales (10 to 100 1/2m) that are characteristic of microfluidic systems typically occur at low Re and thus are dominated by viscosity; inertia plays only a marginal role (4). Viscosity-dominated flows are governed by equations of motion that are linear in the velocity of the fluid. Classic experiments by Taylor (5) demonstrated how low-Re flows can be reversed. A drop of dye added to a viscous fluid between two cylinders was stretched by rotating the inner one and subsequently reconstituted by reversing the direction of rotation. Recently, Pine et al. have investigated a similar system in which colloidal particles in the bulk fluid took the place of the dye in Taylor's experiments (6). They demonstrated that the reversibility of the dynamics of the system depended critically on the number of nonlinear events, that is, collisions between particles, that took place during rotation. In both of these systems and in ours, the motion of the carrier fluid can be approximately described by the reversible Stokes equation (7).Microfluidic systems have recently been used to generate multiphase flows where the fluids include suspended droplets (8-10) and bubbles (11-13) with substantial control over their size, volume fraction in the carrier fluid, and frequency of production (14, 15). The interfacial stresses present in these multiphase systems introduce nonlinearities into the equations of flow, even at low values of Re. These nonlinearities are weak, however, compared with the linear contribution to the dynamics (16), and therefore do not affect the reversibility of the movement of bubbles or droplets through a microchannel.We intentionally introduce an additional, strongly nonlinear component into the interactions that govern the motion of droplets; Fig. 1A shows the device we use. The nonlinearity arises from the binary choice that the droplets make at the T intersection. Each droplet that enters this intersection chooses the branch of the loop through which the hexadecane flows more rapidly-equivalently, the path characterized by the smaller fluidic resistance (17). Because the system operates at a capillary number ( 1.04 s), only one droplet passes through the loop at a time. As the intervals between droplets decreases to 0.90 s, a droplet arrives at the junction while the previous one still occupies the shorter branch. The increase in the fluidic resistance of the shorter branch due to the presence of the droplet is sufficient to divert every second droplet into the longer branch. Because the rates of flow through each of the branches differ, the intervals between droplets exiting the loops repeat in sequences of a longer interval followed by a shorter one (Fig. 1C); we refer to this regime as "period-2". For 0.90 > t > 1.04 s, the system exhibits period-3 and period-4 behavior.As we decrease the intervals between droplets entering the loop, the system displays a series of bifurcations to higher-order periodic and aperiodic behaviors. To characterize the periodicities, we construct Poincare maps, which are plots of the time interval between the nth and n +1st droplet versus the time interval between the nth and n - 1st droplet (Fig. 2A). The two plots on the left (a and c) correspond to the intervals between droplets before they reach the loop for two different values of the mean interval between droplets (0.679 and 0.591 s for sets i and ii). The right-hand plot (b) in set i depicts the system demonstrating period-3 behavior; the 33 points on this plot fall into three clusters. The right-hand plot in set ii (d) shows the system behaving in an aperiodic manner; the 42 intervals measured do not cluster on the Poincare map.

(B) Abifurcation diagram for the system. As the displacement (the height of the ink) increased, the periodicity of the system changed. The numbers above the chart denote the periodicity demonstrated for each range of the height of the reservoir of ink. Gray bars denote areas where the system behaved aperiodically. The states of the system as represented by Poincare maps b and d are marked on the bifurcation diagram. Figure 2B uses a bifurcation diagram to summarize the periodicities we observe for the one-loop system to the extent that our experimental setup allows us to probe. We fix the pressure of the nitrogen applied to the reservoirs of hexadecane and ink and then raise the vial containing the ink in steps of 250 1/2m using a micropositioner. Raising this vial increases the pressure applied to the ink due to gravity, increases its rate of flow, and thus decreases the intervals between droplets entering the loop. The resulting periodicities of the paths selected by the droplets change as we vary the pressure applied to the ink. We observe period-1, -2, -3, -4 and -5 behavior, as well as regimes where the droplets select branches aperiodically. The observation of a bifurcation cascade is typical of many nonlinear systems.To determine whether the dynamics of the system are reversible, we prepare a system containing one loop followed by a spiraling outlet channel 1/29.5 cm long (22) in which we store the sequence of droplets that exit the loop. We set the pressure applied to the hexadecane and the aqueous solution of dye so that the device operates in period-7 mode for a sufficiently long period of time that the spiral channel fills with droplets in a period-7 configuration. We then reverse the direction of flow through the system by toggling two three-way valves. The valves switch the applied pressure from the hexadecane supply to the outlet of the device (23).Figure 3A shows a time-space diagram of droplets traveling forward and backward through the system. As the system initially evolves in time (before the reversal of the direction of flow), the droplets move from left to right in the channel (the loop is positioned in the center of the plot, accounting for the blank space). We plot the position of each droplet within the channel versus time as the system evolves. The bands on the left side of the plot are evenly spaced, the uniform spacing indicating that the droplets enter the left side of the loop separated by constant intervals of time (the standard deviation of the intervals is 1.2% of the mean interval). The bands on the right side of the time-space plot show that the droplets exit the right side of the loop in intervals that repeat in groups of seven. The Poincare map on the right in set i of Fig. 3B confirms that the system operates in a period-7 mode while the continuous liquid flows forward through the system. When we reverse the direction of flow through the channels, the droplets enter the right side of the loop in period-7 mode and emerge from the left side in a stream of uniform periodicity. The standard deviation of the intervals increases, however, to 7.5% of the mean time interval after we reversed the direction of flow. The spiral was large enough to hold 1/210 periods of seven droplets each. The system demonstrates reversibility over five period-7 groups of droplets but fails to reverse the period-7 behavior to period-1 behavior for longer sequences. We believe that the failure in the reversibility of the system after five periods and the increase in the standard deviation of the intervals are caused by the droplets moving closer together as they are stored in the inner ring of the spiral.

We stretched the width of the channel relative to its length by a factor of nine, using Adobe Photoshop, to make the droplets more easily visible. The initial positions of the droplets in the optical micrograph correspond to the points at the top of the plot in (B) to which dashed lines are drawn. The loop is drawn schematically and is not part of the optical micrograph. (B) A plot of the position of droplets in the system as a function of time. Each horizontal slice of this plot represents a snapshot of the system. The black areas signify the presence of a droplet, and the white parts depict the absence of droplets. The droplets initially move from left to right; they enter the loop with uniform separation and exit separated by a repeating sequence of seven intervals. After the direction of flow of hexadecane through the system is reversed, the droplets move from right to left. They enter the loop in period-7 mode and exit with uniform separation. The seven repeating intervals are marked on the right-hand side of the plot. (C) Poincare maps showing the periodicity of the train of droplets (i) before reversal and (ii) after reversal. The maps in (i) plot the nth interval (Tn) versus the n + 1st interval (Tn+1), whereas the maps in (ii) plot the n + 1st versus the nth. In all maps, the intervals are normalized by the mean of the intervals in each set of data (). The reversibility of the dynamics of a system depends on the insensitivity of those dynamics to perturbations. The scatter in the right-hand Poincare map shown in Fig. 3C (ii) demonstrates that the system is subjected to perturbations upon reversal of the direction of flow of hexadecane. Despite these perturbations, the droplets still exit the loop in a period-1 fashion. The dynamics therefore preserve the coherence of the signal.The device with one loop that we described previously demonstrates reversibility upon reversal of the direction of flow. We found that period-2 sequences, however, are reversible if the droplets are sent forward through a second loop identical to, and downstream of, the first one (Fig. 4, A and B). This property of reversibility without requiring a reversal of the direction of flow is due to backward/forward symmetry. The period-2 sequence ABABAB (where A denotes a longer interval and B a shorter one) looks exactly the same whether read in the forward or reverse direction, with a B always following an A.

Droplets arrived at the first loop separated by varying, aperiodic time intervals, which form a signal, and emerge from the first loop encoded in a period-2 fashion. They then traverse the second loop, and the time intervals between the droplets return to the original sequence. The loops in (A) were positioned such that the shorter branch in the first loop was on a different side of the device than the shorter branch in the second loop. The loops in (B) were positioned so that the shorter branches were on the same side of the device. The two configurations result qualitatively in the same behavior. (C and D) Plots showing the input and encoded analog signals (C) and the input and decoded signals (D) obtained using the device in (A). (E and F) Plots showing the input and encoded digital signals (E) and input and decoded signals (F) obtained using the device in (B). Each peak above the y-axis value of 0.280 s represents a 1, while each valley below 0.225 s represents a 0. The digital signal 100101 is equivalent to the decimal number 37. The arrows in (E) show the bits in the input signal that do not appear in the encoded signal but reappear in the decoded signal in (F). We use the two-loop device to encode and decode a signal comprising the intervals of time between droplets. We use the device in Fig. 4A to process an analog signal and the device in Fig. 4B to process a digital one, although both devices are capable of processing either type of signal. To encode the analog signal, we modulate the pressure applied to the reservoir of ink about the value corresponding to the midpoint of the region characterized by period-2 behavior by adjusting the height of the reservoir of ink between 1 mm using the micropositioner. Changing the height of the ink in this manner allows for precise control of the pressure applied to the ink. Displacing the reservoir upwards by 0.1 mm results in an increase in pressure of only 0.002 pounds per square inch (psi). The droplets that form while we raise and lower the reservoir of ink are separated by aperiodic intervals of time that range from 0.68 s to 0.86 s. We recorded the time that passes between consecutive droplets moving through the regions marked as "input signal," "encoded signal," and "decoded signal" in Fig. 4A. The first loop encodes the droplets by dramatically changing the sequence of intervals of time between droplets (Fig. 4C). The intervals of the encoded signal differ from the intervals of the input signal by an average of 33.3%. The second loop then decodes the signal (Fig. 4D). The intervals of the decoded signal differ from those that form the input signal by an average of 2.3%.To encode a digital signal, we use an electronically controlled valve (23) to adjust the pressure applied to the reservoir of ink. We set the baseline for the code by applying 1.075 V to the valve (which applies 1/23.18 psi of pressure to the reservoir of ink) and 3.26 psi of pressure to the reservoir of hexadecane. The droplets then reach the first loop separated by 0.263 0.005 s. To create a value of 1, we decrease the voltage applied to the valve to 1.074 V to decrease the pressure applied to the ink and increase the intervals between droplets. To express a 0, we conversely increase the voltage applied to the valve to 1.076 V. Figure 4, E and F, shows the input, encoded, and decoded signals for the binary number 100101, which corresponds to the decimal number 37. Two bits in the input signal-the first and last 1's-do not appear in the encoded signal in Fig. 4E. In these two instances, two consecutive droplets (the intervals between which formed the peak of the signals) are separated by sufficiently long periods of time that both droplets choose the same path through the loop. Unexpectedly, the 1's are restored to the signal after the droplets pass through the second loop, although the peaks appear one interval later than in the input signal. This experiment demonstrates that the system can faithfully decode a nontrivially encoded signal.Pine et al. recently studied the boundary between reversibility and irreversibility in the flow of a viscous suspension of colloidal particles. They showed that a critical number of nonlinear collisions between the particles initiates the transition to irreversibility. We used the combination of nonlinear events-the selection of paths by bubbles-and the linear nature of the viscous flow of fluids through microchannels to obtain complex behavior while preserving the reversibility of the system. We used this reversible, nonlinear system to encrypt and decrypt information. The reversible dynamics of the encoder/decoder described in Fig. 4 demonstrate that uncontrolled perturbations do not prevent the manipulation of data coded in trains of droplets. The encoder/decoder is an example of a microfluidic device that generates complex control of trajectories of droplets (e.g., directing drops into predefined branches of microfluidic networks) without using valves or switches.
AbstractWe demonstrate universal computation in an all-fluidic two-phase microfluidic system. Nonlinearity is introduced into an otherwise linear, reversible, low-Reynolds number flow via bubble-to-bubble hydrodynamic interactions. A bubble traveling in a channel represents a bit, providing us with the capability to simultaneously transport materials and perform logical control operations. We demonstrate bubble logic AND/OR/NOT gates, a toggle flip-flop, a ripple counter, timing restoration, a ring oscillator, and an electro-bubble modulator. These show the nonlinearity, gain, bistability, synchronization, cascadability, feedback, and programmability required for scalable universal computation. With increasing complexity in large-scale microfluidic processors, bubble logic provides an on-chip process control mechanism integrating chemistry and computation.Microfluidic "lab-on-a-chip" devices, where picoliters of fluids can be precisely manipulated in microscopic channels under controlled reaction conditions, have revolutionized analytical chemistry and biosciences. Recent advances in elastomeric pneumatic microvalves (1) and large-scale integration (2) have enabled complex process control for a wide variety (3, 4) of applications in single-phase microreactors. However, pneumatic elastomeric microvalves require external macroscopic solenoids for their operation, and cascadability and feedback (where a signal acts on itself) are currently lacking in microfluidic control architectures.Several reaction chemistries have been implemented in segmented-flow two-phase microreactors, where individual nanoliter droplets traveling inside microchannels are used as reaction containers (5, 6). Dielectrophoretic (7) and electrostatic (8) schemes have been proposed for on-chip droplet management, but these require external control of individual gates. Devices that exploit the dynamics of droplets inside microchannels would make high-throughput screening and combinatorial studies possible (9), but passive techniques (10, 11) have not provided control over individual droplets.We demonstrate bubble logic that implements universal Boolean logic in physical fluid dynamics. This provides a droplet-level, internal, inherently digital flow control mechanism for microfluidic processors. A bubble traveling in a microchannel can represent a bit of information as well as carry a chemical payload, making it possible to integrate chemistry with computation for process control. Bubble logic preserves the information representation from input to output; thus, devices can be cascaded, allowing implementation of combinatorial and sequential Boolean logic. A bubble can be transported to a desired location in a complex microfluidic network via a series of logic gates corresponding to an equivalent Boolean circuit.Logic gates have been implemented chemically in chemical concentration waves in a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction (12) and in DNA (13). Purely hydrodynamic fluidic logic (14) was used to build a trajectory controller, an all-fluidic display, nondestructive memory, and a simple computer (15). Because the high Reynolds numbers required for inertial interactions cannot be maintained in the microscopic geometries needed for higher operating speeds and increasing integration, fluids with non-Newtonian polymer additives have been used to realize a constant flow source and a bistable gate (16, 17). Boolean logic in a single-phase Newtonian fluid was implemented by changes in flow resistance (18), but because its input and output representation were not the same, these devices could not be cascaded. Bubble logic, based on hydrodynamic bubble-to-bubble interactions, is more similar in bit representation to theoretical billiard ball logic (19) based on the elastic collision of particles, and to magnetic bubble memory (20) relying on interactions of magnetic domains in garnet films. These schemes all conserve information, because during a logic operation a bit is neither created nor destroyed.The pressure-driven flow of bubbles in an interconnected microfluidic network can be described with a simplified dynamic flow resistance model (21). Single-phase flow resistance of a channel at low Reynolds number can be approximated as p/Q 1/2L/h3w, where p/LQ is defined as the hydraulic resistance per unit length, 1/2 is the dynamic viscosity, and h and w are the height and width of the microchannel. The pressure drop due to a long bubble flowing in a channel, where the bubble radius in an unbounded fluid is greater than the channel width and the continuous phase completely wets the channel surface, is nonlinear and is proportional to p /w(3Ca2/3), where Ca is the capillary number (Ca = 1/2u/), u is the flow velocity of the continuous phase, and is the surface tension between liquid and gas phase (22, 23). For small flow rates, this increased flow resistance is primarily due to viscous dissipation in the thin film of liquid surrounding the bubble. With the presence of surfactant molecules on the air-water interface, viscous dissipation in the lubrication film further increases as a result of the no-slip boundary conditions at the interface. In this case, the pressure drop across a finite-length bubble is also linearly dependent on the bubble length until it reaches a critical value, beyond which it is constant (24). When a bubble traveling in a microchannel arrives at a bifurcation with low capillary number (where the bubble does not split because surface tension dominates the viscous stress), it chooses the branch with highest instantaneous flow (25, 26).With an increased flow resistance due to the presence of a bubble in a microchannel, flow lines in surrounding interconnected channels can be perturbed. The nonlinearity in such a system arises from the introduction of interfacial force terms from the boundary conditions due to the presence of a free surface at the fluid interfaces (27). These nonlinear time-dependent interactions are the basis of our bubble logic gates. In the implementation described here, we used water as the liquid medium [with added surfactant 2% (w/w) Tween 20 to stabilize the interfaces] and nitrogen bubbles. Planar bubble logic devices were fabricated in poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) by single-layer soft lithography and plasma bonding to Pyrex substrates.Figure 1 (top row; see also movie S1) shows an AND/OR bubble logic gate that evaluates both AND () and OR (+) simultaneously, as is necessary to satisfy bit conservation. As shown in the center column, the first bubble arriving at the junction always enters A+B (the wider channel, with less resistance), increasing the output flow resistance of A+B and thus directing a bubble arriving later to AB. The time trace plotted for all four channels shows that the two bubbles interact only if they arrive within a window 0 (for this gate 0 1/20.5 ms at flow rate Q =0.25 1/2l/s) determined by the residence time of the bubble in the gate geometry. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Universal microfluidic bubble logic. The top row shows a two-input AND-OR gate. The channel height is 70 1/2m; scale bar, 100 1/2m. With a water flow rate of 0.25 1/2l/s and nitrogen bubbles with a pressure of 0.5 psi, the gate propagation delay is 2 ms. The bottom row depicts a universal AB gate with gain that can be used to switch a larger bubble by a smaller one. For the bubbles shown, the ratio of the size of the input to the control is 1.2, and the graph shows the nonlinear dependence of the inlet flow on the control bubble size for two ratios of the control to the inlet flow rate. Fan-out for the output signal from one gate to act as an input signal for multiple gates can be implemented by splitting bubbles at a T junction (25), requiring restoration of the bubble size. Figure 1 (bottom row; see also movie S2) demonstrates a universal AB gate, which implements a NOT and AND with gain so that a smaller bubble can switch a larger one. There are two counteracting asymmetries: an input channel with an asymmetric T junction (bottom), and a narrow stream of injected flow from the control channel (top) into the wider of the two bifurcations. By introducing a bubble into the control channel, injected side flow can be dynamically turned on and off, thereby enabling control of the direction of flow of the output bubble arriving at the bifurcation (bottom row, center column). The change in injected flow from the control channel (Q) when a bubble passes through is nonlinearly related to the size of the bubble, providing gain as plotted in Fig. 1 (bottom row, right column) against the dimensionless bubble size (bubble length/channel width).Segmented-flow reactors often operate at kilohertz frequencies, where the limiting factor for high-throughput screening is the rate of information extraction from individual droplets. We present a bistable mechanism (Fig. 2 and movie S3) capable of on-demand trapping and release of individual bubbles, implemented as a flip-flop memory. A bubble minimizes its surface energy by adopting a shape with the smallest surface area. The flip-flop geometry (Fig. 2A) presents an incoming bubble with two elliptical lobes where the surface energy of the bubble is at a minimum, as shown in the plot of energy versus time (Fig. 2G and fig. S1A). The device holds a single bubble indefinitely until it is toggled by another bubble arriving at the inlet, dislodging the stored bubble by flow through the channel connecting the lobes. Although the incoming bubbles are much longer than the Rayleigh-Plateau criteria for breakup (25), the presence of a bubble in the flip-flop ensures that the incoming bubble travels to a single lobe without breakup (the bifurcation diagram is plotted in fig. S1B and the repeatability in the time trace in fig. S1C). We have used this mechanism to implement a bistable flow switch (fig. S2), with a switching time an order of magnitude less than that for comparable macroscopic elements such as solenoid valves (1), as well as a cascaded ripple counter (Fig. 2H).

(H) Flip-flops cascaded to form a ripple counter. To provide an electronic interface to bubble logic devices, we developed a thermal electro-bubble modulator (Fig. 3 and movie S4) capable of generating bubbles on demand synchronized to an electric pulse. Methods for high-frequency continuous production of monodisperse microbubbles and droplets in microfluidic devices have been extensively studied (27-29). Electrogeneration of on-demand single aqueous droplets (30) requires high on-chip electric fields on the order of 1/21 kV. Our thermal electro-bubble generator uses an integrated microheater and modified flow-focusing geometry (Fig. 3), enabling operation at a much lower voltage (21 V). For the case of pressure-driven flow (Fig. 3A), there is a static balance at the air-water interface P + v = Ca-1k (29), where P is the difference in pressure, v is the viscous stress, and k represents the mean curvature. An applied temperature pulse reduces the surface tension at the air-water interface, allowing a gas filament to penetrate the liquid (Fig. 3D), which breaks to form a single bubble (Fig. 3E).

A platinum microheater (width 50 1/2m, thickness 200 nm, R = 95 ohms) followed by a 2-1/2m silicon dioxide dielectric barrier is embedded below a planar flow-focusing geometry (channel height 70 1/2m, water flow rate 0.83 1/2l/s, nitrogen pressure 5 psi). Scale bar, 100 1/2m. (A to C) A 21-V dc pulse is applied to the heater for 100 ms, resulting in the growth of a meniscus. Arrows indicate direction of flow. (D) A gas filament penetrates the water. (E) The filament breaks into a single drop via flow focusing (28), followed by (F) the interface retracting. A standard test of cascadability and feedback in a new logic family is steady-state operation of a ring oscillator. We implemented this with three identical AND gates connected via three delay lines in a ring structure (Fig. 4A and movie S5) with constant-frequency T-junction bubble generators at the inputs. A bubble propagating around the ring delay line (Fig. 4A, arrow) increases the resistance of the outgoing channel when it arrives at the input of one of the three AND gates, generating a pressure pulse that launches another bubble in response. The oscillation frequency of this device can be written as f 1/[3(l/v + d)], where f is the oscillator frequency, l is the length of the delay line, v is the mean velocity of the bubble traveling in the delay line, and d is the propagation delay of the AND gate. This frequency can be tuned by increasing the flow rate of the continuous phase (Fig. 4B). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 4.

(C) A fluidic ladder network for timing restoration. With a flow rate of 0.5 1/2l/s, a restoration of 1/210 ms is achieved over a span of 1/240 ms. Scale bar, 100 1/2m. The operation of bubble logic requires the relative arrival of bubbles at a gate to be within a transit time; scalability requires restoration of relative timing errors. We achieved this via a planar fluidic resistance ladder network. This geometry (Fig. 4C and movie S6) places interconnecting fluid channels (continuous-phase flow resistance r) between two data-carrying channels (continuous-phase flow resistance R, with r > R). A single bubble traversing the ladder is slowed down by flow through the alternate path. When both bubbles are present simultaneously, there is a net flow from the channel with the leading bubble to the one with the lagging bubble, creating a relative velocity gradient until the bubbles are synchronized (fig. S3).Because bubble logic chips have no moving parts, they can be fabricated in a wide variety of materials, including silicon and glass, that are compatible with reaction chemistries unsuitable for PDMS channels. Moreover, because they operate at low Reynolds and capillary numbers, further reduction in size is feasible with faster switching times. The device mechanisms do not depend on non-Newtonian fluid properties; hence, matching dimensionless flow parameters will allow bubble logic circuits to be designed using different fluids, such as water droplets in oil or oil droplets in water.The universal logic gates, toggle flip-flop, ripple counter, synchronizer, ring oscillator, and electro-bubble modulator presented here exhibit nonlinearity, bistability, gain, synchronization, cascading, feedback, and programmability. Having shown the required properties of a scalable logic family, they can be used to create complex microfluidic circuits capable of performing arbitrary fluid process control and computation in an integrated fashion. Such circuits may reduce the size, cost, and complexity of current microfluidic systems, thereby enabling the development of very-large-scale microfluidic reactors for use in areas including combinatorial chemistry and drug discovery. These bubble logic processors, where a bit of information can also carry a chemical payload, merge chemistry with computation.
AbstractIron(V)-oxo species have been proposed as key reactive intermediates in the catalysis of oxygen-activating enzymes and synthetic catalysts. Here, we report the synthesis of [Fe(TAML)(O)]- in nearly quantitative yield, where TAML is a macrocyclic tetraamide ligand. Mass spectrometry, Mossbauer, electron paramagnetic resonance, and x-ray absorption spectroscopies, as well as reactivity studies and density functional theory calculations show that this long-lived (hours at -60C) intermediate is a spin S = 1/2 iron(V)-oxo complex. Iron-TAML systems have proven to be efficient catalysts in the decomposition of numerous pollutants by hydrogen peroxide, and the species we characterized is a likely reactive intermediate in these reactions.High-valent iron-oxo intermediates are used in biological systems to carry out challenging oxidations in many scenarios (1-3). It has long been known that heme-based systems, biological as well as synthetic, do not attain the iron(V) state. Rather, the so-called "Compound I" intermediate involves the FeIV(oxo)(porphyrin-radical-cation), FeIV(O)(P+), which is well established in peroxidases and catalases and presumed with considerable justification to be the reactive oxidizing species of the cytochrome P450s (1). Recently, Newcomb and co-workers reported laser flash photolysis experiments of an iron-corrole complex (4) and cytochrome P450 mutant CYP 119 (5), in which optically detected transients were tentatively assigned to FeV-oxo species. Que and co-workers, on the basis of 18O labeling experiments, have postulated that an HO-FeV-oxo oxidant is an intermediate in the large family of Rieske dioxygenase enzymes (3). Iron(V) complexes are exceedingly rare, but recently, Wieghardt and co-workers reported spectroscopic evidence for a non-heme S = 1/2 iron(V)-nitrido complex produced by photolysis of an azidoiron(III) precursor (6).Tetraamido macrocyclic ligands (TAMLs) can stabilize a variety of high-valent iron complexes, including a high-spin (S = 2) iron(IV) complex, intermediate-spin (S = 1) iron(IV) complexes, oxo-bridged diiron(IV) dimers, and an S = 1 iron(III)(TAML-radical-cation) complex [all reviewed in (7)]. The structurally characterized oxo-bridged complex, [(FeIVB*)2(1/2-oxo)]2-, 2, (B*, a TAML, is shown in Fig. 1) was obtained by reacting the monomeric iron(III) precursor, [FeIIIB*(H2O)]-, 1, with air (8). Fe-TAML activation of peroxide has been shown to be useful in numerous applications (9, 10). The deprotonated TAML (a tetraanion) presents the iron with four exceptionally strong amido-N -donors. Therefore, it has been reasonable to expect (11) that this macrocyclic ligand would be capable of stabilizing an oxo-iron(V) complex when an FeIII(TAML) complex is treated with an oxygen-atom transfer agent such as peroxide. A variety of iron(IV) complexes have been synthesized by reacting iron(II) precursors with oxygen donors in organic solvents such that the reaction can be monitored optically at temperatures as low as -80C (12, 13). A similar approach was applied here to FeIII precursors to monitor short-lived intermediates in the reactions of TAML complexes. We report the synthesis of a d3 iron(V)-oxo complex, in nearly quantitative yield, and its characterization with optical, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Mossbauer, and x-ray absorption spectroscopies, as well as electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), reactivity studies, and density functional theory (DFT).

The inset shows the iron(III)-aqua complex 1, [FeIIIB*(H2O)]- where the free-base H4B* tetraamide is 3,3,6,6,9,9-hexamethyl-3,4,8,9-tetrahydro-1H-1,4,8,11-benzotetraazacyclotridecine-2,5,7,10(6H,11H)-tetraone. The reaction of [PPh4][FeIIIB*(H2O)] (1, 1 to 2 mM) with 2 to 5 equivalents (equiv) of m-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) at -60C in n-butyronitrile (14) produces within about 10 s the diiron(IV) dimer, 2 (Fig. 1, dotted line). The reaction then proceeds through an as-yet uncharacterized EPR-silent Fe(IV) intermediate (a Mossbauer spectrum is shown in fig. S3) to yield, within 15 min after the addition of mCPBA, a deep green species, 3. Complex 3 (Fig. 1, solid line) exhibits distinct absorption maxima at 445 nm (where the extinction coefficient, mu , is 5400 M-1 cm-1, calibrated by reference to Mossbauer spectra) and 630 nm ( mu =4200 M-1 cm-1). At -60C, 3 decays by 10% in 90 min, but it is stable for at least one month at 77 K. Complex 3 was also obtained in acetonitrile at -40C, but at this temperature it decays by 10% in about 5 min, probably by attacking the solvent (11). In the course of our studies, we learned that 3 can be obtained quantitatively with 1 equiv of mCPBA when small amounts of potential ligands such as water, pyridine, and benzoic acid were present. The spectral features of 3 were independent of the presence of these potential ligands.ESI-MS examination of n-butyronitrile solutions of 3 revealed one prominent ion at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 442.2, the mass and isotopic distribution pattern of which correspond to a formulation of [FeVB*(O)]- [see supporting online material (SOM) text and fig. S1]. Only one other peak was observed, at m/z = 581.1, and it corresponded to a decay product of 3, namely [FeIVB*(m-chlorobenzoate)]-. Introduction of H218O into the solvent media yielded upto 35% of [FeVB*(18O)]- (m/z = 444.2) after 30 min of incubation; presently, we do not know at what stage of the reaction the 18O exchange occurs.In the 28 K EPR spectrum of 3 (Fig. 2A, solid line), prepared at -60C in the glass-forming solvent, n-butyronitrile, the major feature belongs to an S = 1/2 species with g values of about 1.99, 1.97, and 1.74. [g values are the eigenvalues of tensor g, which couples the electronic spin, S, to the applied magnetic field, B (Eq. 1).] The dashed line represents a spectral simulation, drawn to correspond to an S =1/2 spin concentration of 0.92(5) (estimated error from spectral simulation in the least significant digit) spins per Fe molecule.

The dashed line is a spectral simulation for the majority species, 3, using the following parameters: gx = 1.985, gy = 1.966, gz = 1.735, with g values assumed to have a Gaussian distribution with gx = 0.02, gy = 0.03, and gz = 0.05, using a packet width of 1 mT. The y axis of the EPR spectrum is expressed in arbitrary units. (B) Mossbauer spectra of about 2 mM 57Fe-enriched [FeVB*(O)]-, 3, in n-butyronitrile recorded at 140 K (i) and 4.2 K (ii and iii) in magnetic fields indicated; incident beam perpendicular (ii) and parallel (i and iii) to the applied field. The solid lines are spectral simulations based on Eq. 1 using the parameters of Table 1; as drawn they represent 95% of the total absorption. Arrows (in i and ii) indicate a decay product (3% of Fe) of 3 with EQ = 3.4 mm/s and = 0.08 mm/s. We studied samples of 3 with Mossbauer spectroscopy between 4.2 and 140 K in applied magnetic fields up to 8.0 T. Three representative spectra of a sample prepared at -60C are shown in Fig. 2B; additional spectra are displayed in fig. S2. The majority species contributes nearly 95% of the absorption, and thus we associate it with the majority S = 1/2 species observed by EPR. The Mossbauer spectra of 3 were simulated with the S = 1/2 spin Hamiltonian (1) In Eq. 1, is the Bohr magneton; S is the electron spin operator; g is the g tensor; B is the applied magnetic field; A is the 57Fe magnetic hyperfine tensor; I is the nuclear spin operator; gNN is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio; Ix, Iy, and Iz are the Cartesian components of I; and the last term describes the interaction between the nuclear quadrupole moment Q and the electric field gradient (EFG) tensor [principal components Vxx, Vyy, Vzz; with = (Vxx - Vyy)/Vzz].At 4.2 K, the electronic spin of 3 relaxes slowly on the time scale of Mossbauer spectroscopy (about 10-7 s), and thus we observed paramagnetic hyperfine structure. At 140 K, the spin system approaches the fast relaxation limit, and the magnetic hyperfine interactions were essentially averaged out. The spectrum i of Fig. 2B exhibits a doublet (solid line) with quadrupole splitting EQ =4.25 mm/s and isomer shift = -0.46(2) mm/s (relative to Fe metal at 298 K); = -0.42(3) mm/s at 4.2 K. This value is considerably lower than the lowest observed for any Fe-TAML complex, specifically = -0.18 mm/s (at 4.2 K) for an S = 1 iron(IV) complex (table S5). Because 3 has a half-integral electronic spin, we assigned this species to a low-spin d3 [FeVB*(O)]- complex, in accord with the mass spectroscopic data. The solid lines in Fig. 2B are spectral simulations based on Eq. 1 according to the parameters listed in Table 1. The theoretical curves in ii and iii in Fig. 2B represent 95% of the total Fe in the sample, in excellent agreement with the EPR data [0.92(5)] spins per Fe molecule]. Table 1.

(The Fe K edge corresponds to the transition of the iron 1 s electron to the continuum of electron states.) A sample in frozen CH3CN solvent, 70% pure in 3, exhibits a K edge at 7125.3 eV, an energy value 1.4 eV higher than that associated with its iron(III) precursor 1 and thus consistent with the higher oxidation state of 3. The 1s 3d pre-edge transition found for the sample of 3 is quite intense, with an area of 48 units compared with 17 units for 1 (Fig. 3A). Taking into account that only 70% of the sample is 3 [the remainder being Fe(IV)], a preedge area of at least 60 units can be estimated for pure 3. This value is distinctly larger than those observed for known S = 1 six-coordinate oxoiron(IV) species (25 to 38 units) (12). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

The inset shows Fourier-filtered EXAFS spectra (k3'(k)) (dots) and the fit (solid line). Fourier transform range k = 2 to 14.9 A-1; back-transform range: r' = 0.70 to 3.00 A. The fitting protocol is detailed in SOM text. Direct evidence for an iron-oxo unit is obtained from an analysis of the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) region of the x-ray absorption spectrum (Fig. 3B). The best fit obtained considers three shells: 0.7 O scatterer (fixed on the basis of the Mossbauer analysis of this sample) at 1.58A, four N/O scatterers at 1.87A, and five C scatterers at 2.82A (see SOM text for details of the fitting protocol). Whereas the scatterers at 1.87 and 2.82 A are consistent with low Z atoms from the macrocyclic ligand as found in the EXAFS fits for 1, the 1.58 A scatterer is unique for 3 and assigned to the oxo atom of an Fe-O unit. Thus, 3 can be formulated as [FeVB*(O)]- by a combination of evidence from electrospray mass spectrometry, EPR, Mossbauer analysis, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy.Consistent with the above formulation, 3 displays the signature reactivity features of a strongly oxidizing iron-oxo complex. Thus, reaction of excess triphenylphosphine (10 equiv) with preformed 3 [1 mM in 500:1 volume by volume acetonitrile to water, with the use of 1 equiv of mCPBA at -40C] quantitatively produced triphenylphosphine oxide (1 mM OPPh3), regenerating 1. When this reaction was carried out in the presence of H218O (0.2% by volume), incorporation of 18O in the oxidized product was observed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry studies. As described in the SOM text (table S3), oxidation proceeded readily with other substrates under similar conditions, also showing 18O incorporation when H218O was present. Thioanisole was oxidized quantitatively to the corresponding sulfoxide. Substoichiometric reactions with styrene and cyclooctene produced the corresponding epoxides; reaction with ethylbenzene gave a mixture of 1-phenylethanol and acetophenone. In these cases where 3 did not revert completely to iron(III), a mixture of lower-valent iron complexes was produced, including the diiron(IV) dimer, 2. Oxidation of 9,10-dihydroanthracene proceeded quantitatively to anthracene and 2.DFT calculations using Gaussian with the functional B3LYP and basis set 6-311G clearly favor the low-spin (S = 1/2) [FeVB*(O)]- configuration as the ground state of 3. A geometry-optimized structure together with an orbital diagram is shown in Fig. 4. The calculated Fe-O bond length of 1.60 A is in excellent agreement with our EXAFS results. This distance is 0.04 to 0.1 A shorter than those reported for FeIV=O complexes (13). The contraction of the Fe-O bond reflects an increase in the formal bond order from 2 in FeIV=O to 2.5. The Fe atom is displaced out of the 4-N plane by 0.5 A. DFT calculations showed the lowest excited S = 3/2 state to be an FeIV-TAML cation radical state, [FeIV(B*)+(O)]-, at 1900 cm-1 rather than the metal-based state obtained by a spin flip transition from xy to xz (15).

For clarity, hydrogen atoms are not shown. Electronic d-orbital diagram of the FeV center is shown, as derived from DFT. Selected bond lengths: Fe-O, 1.60 A; Fe-N, 1.86 A (two nitrogens along x direction) and 1.91 A (two nitrogens along y direction); the Fe is 0.5 A above the plane defined by the four amide nitrogens. One-electron oxidations of iron-oxo-porphyrinates are generally ligand based rather than metal based as in 3 (16). A major factor contributing to this difference is the stronger -donor capacity of the deprotonated amide nitrogens of a TAML tetraanion compared with the pyrroles of the porphyrin dianion. Hence, the TAML injects more electronic charge into the 3d shell than does a porphyrin, thereby raising the energy of the redox-active metal orbital and protecting the iron(V) against electron transfer from the phenyl moiety.The values calculated for , EQ, , and Ax,y,z (Table 1) provide strong support to our iron(V) assignment. The isomeric shift calculated for [FeVB*(O)]-, = -0.39 mm/s, is in excellent agreement with the data and is substantially lower than that calculated for [FeIV(B*)+(O)]-, = -0.15 mm/s (calculated values for Fe-TAML complexes agree within 0.02 to 0.03 mm/s with the experimental values; see table S5). The removal of a 3d electron (reducing the shielding of the nuclear charge) and the shortening of the Fe-O bond distance (enhancing the covalent 4s population) each increase the electron density at the Fe nucleus, thus decreasing . In contrast, the removal of an electron from the redox-active ligand orbital has a minor effect on (e.g., = -0.15 mm/s for [FeIV(B*)+(O)]- compared with = -0.12 mm/s for [FeIV(B*)(O)]2-)(table S5). Inspection of the DFT results shows that the Fe-O bond of 3 has nearly the same covalency as the Fe-O bonds in FeIV=O complexes (12, 17, 18). The calculated unpaired spin density on the oxo group of 3 is 0.22, which is less than expected (0.4) by comparison with FeIV=O complexes (0.8); the difference can be traced to a spin polarization of the bonding (px + dxz) orbital. The exchange potential generated by the electron places the virtual level below the level. As a consequence, the transfer of electron density from to is greater than from to , resulting in a negative spin density in px, which, combined with the positive spin density for py (1/20.4), yields a net spin density of less than 0.4.The z axis of Eq. 1 parallels the Fe-O bond within 5. The unpaired electron in the dyz orbital produces a large negative x component of the spin-dipolar part of the A tensor, A(s-d)i/gNN = (-24.4, +8.7, +15.7) T, and together with the isotropic contact term gives the larger A value along x. Owing to the large energy gaps between the narrowly spaced (dxz, dyz) pair and the other 3d levels, spin-orbit coupling acts primarily between dxz and dyz and produces (i) an effective g value gz = 2(1 - /)(gx and gy are not affected) and (ii) an orbital contribution to the magnetic hyperfine interaction, ALzIzSz, where ALz = P(gz - 2) -13 T. Substitution of = 260 cm-1 and DFT = 2000 cm-1 gives the observed value gz = 1.74 and ALz = -13 T (19).Complex 3 thus appears to have a low-spin d3 configuration in contrast to a recently described isoelectronic manganese(IV)-oxo complex (20), which is high spin, S = 3/2, by EPR criteria. Our particular interest in TAML-catalyzed reactions pertains to their proven potential in green chemistry. The present work provides an opportunity to elucidate elementary steps in the catalytic cycles of TAML activators by taking advantage of the high purity of 3, with its various prominent spectroscopic signatures, as a stoichiometric reagent.
AbstractVitamin A has diverse biological functions. It is transported in the blood as a complex with retinol binding protein (RBP), but the molecular mechanism by which vitamin A is absorbed by cells from the vitamin A-RBP complex is not clearly understood. We identified in bovine retinal pigment epithelium cells STRA6, a multitransmembrane domain protein, as a specific membrane receptor for RBP. STRA6 binds to RBP with high affinity and has robust vitamin A uptake activity from the vitamin A-RBP complex. It is widely expressed in embryonic development and in adult organ systems. The RBP receptor represents a major physiological mediator of cellular vitamin A uptake.Vitamin A and its derivatives are essential for vision (1) and many other biological processes, because they are involved in the proliferation and differentiation of many cell types throughout life (2, 3). The majority of dietary vitamin A is stored in the liver. The principal physiological carrier of vitamin A (retinol) in the blood for delivery to other organs is retinol binding protein (RBP) (4). RBP is responsible for a well-regulated transport system that provides an evolutionary advantage by helping vertebrates adapt to fluctuations in vitamin A in natural environments (5). RBP also functions as a signal in insulin resistance (6). Loss of RBP makes mice extremely sensitive to vitamin A deficiency, because the hepatic vitamin A store can no longer be mobilized (7). Even with a nutritionally complete diet, RBP knockout mice have dramatically lower serum vitamin A concentrations, similar to the concentrations in the later stages of vitamin A deficiency in humans. Given the role of vitamin A in immune regulation and the susceptibility of vitamin A-deficient children to infection before visual symptoms (8), it is likely that the immune system is compromised in RBP knockout mice even under vitamin A-sufficient conditions. Indeed, the circulating immunoglobulin amount in these mice is half of that in wild-type mice, even under vitamin A sufficiency (9). In humans, loss of RBP function causes a dark adaptation defect and progressive atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) at young ages (10). Under conditions of vitamin A deficiency at which wild-type mice behave normally, RBP knockout mice have severe developmental defects in embryos (11) and rapid vision loss in adults after merely a week of vitamin A deficiency (7). In addition, these mice rapidly develop testicular defects (12).It was first shown in the 1970s that there exists a specific cell surface receptor for RBP on the RPE and on intestinal epithelial cells (13-16). During the past 3 decades, evidence has also accumulated for the existence of the RBP receptor on other tissue or cell types, including the placenta (17-20), choroid plexus (18, 21), testis (18, 22), and macrophages (23). The cell surface RBP receptor not only specifically binds to RBP but also mediates vitamin A uptake from vitamin A-loaded RBP (holo-RBP) (15-17, 20, 22, 23). Here, we report the identification of the RBP receptor as STRA6, a widely expressed multitransmembrane domain protein. STRA6 met all three criteria expected of the RBP receptor. First, it conferred RBP binding to transfected cells. Second, it mediated cellular uptake of vitamin A. Third, it was localized to the cellular locations expected of the RBP receptor in native tissues.Identification of the RBP receptor as STRA6. Potential obstacles to purifying the RBP receptor included the fragility of the receptor protein and the transient nature of binding. We designed a strategy to stabilize the RBP-receptor interaction, and this strategy permitted high affinity purification of the RBP-receptor complex. The strategy combined the 6Xhistidine tag (His tag)-nickel system and a bifunctional cross-linker with an amine-reactive group and a photoreactive group (Fig. 1A). We used bovine RPE cells as the starting material because they are known to express the RBP receptor at high concentrations (13). Because N-terminal alkaline phosphatase (AP)-tagged RBP was able to specifically bind to its receptor on RPE cells with a staining pattern expected for basolateral membranes (Fig. 1B), we created His-tagged RBP (His-RBP) by tagging at the N terminus of RBP. After binding purified His-RBP protein conjugated with the cross-linker to RPE membranes, ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking, membrane solubilization, and nickel resin purification, we observed a covalent protein complex of about 80 kD containing RBP and its putative receptor (Fig. 1C). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the RBP binding protein in the complex was STRA6, a protein that has 11 putative transmembrane domains but has no homology to any protein with known function (fig. S1). STRA6 is a retinoic acid-induced gene in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells (24). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

Scale bars indicate 10 1/2m. (C) Immunoblot analysis using an antibody against RBP. Molecular weight marker is shown on the left (in kD). The His-RBP monomer band represents His-RBP that was bound to RPE membrane but not cross-linked to the receptor. Untagged RBP competition in lane 4 prevented His-RBP from binding to RPE membrane and therefore lowered signals for both the complex and the monomer band. STRA6 mediates RBP binding and vitamin A uptake from holo-RBP. To test whether STRA6 could confer RBP binding to transfected cells, we transfected bovine STRA6 cDNA into COS-1 cells. Bovine STRA6-transfected but not untransfected cells bound to AP-RBP with high affinity (Kd = 59 nM) (Fig. 2, A and B). An excess of unlabeled RBP blocked this binding activity (Fig. 2B). To test whether STRA6 could enhance cellular vitamin A uptake from holo-RBP, we performed both 3H-retinol-based assays (Fig. 2C) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based assays (Fig. 2, D to H). STRA6 expression dramatically increased cellular vitamin A uptake from holo-RBP. Vitamin A is preferentially stored as retinyl esters after uptake from holo-RBP (25). Lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) is the enzyme that converts retinol into retinyl ester (26) and plays an important role in vitamin A storage (27, 28). Thus, we included LRAT expression in most vitamin A uptake assays. By using an assay based on 3H-retinol-RBP, we found that STRA6 activity was most evident in the presence of LRAT (Fig. 2C), because LRAT makes it possible to store vitamin A at high concentration in the form of retinyl esters, the more stable derivative of vitamin A. In these assays, nearly all specific vitamin A uptake activity, which was sensitive to blocking by an excess of unlabeled RBP, was due to STRA6. Vitamin A uptake by COS-1 cells transfected with STRA6 and LRAT was highly efficient. When the concentration of 3H-retinol-RBP was 3 nM in the medium and cell density was 1.8 * 106 cells/ml, about 25% of the total radioactivity was taken up by cells in 1 hour, and about 50% of the total radioactivity was taken up by cells in 2 hours. The amount of retinol taken up by cells in 1 hour is about 4.6 times the moles of RBP bound to the cell surface at steady state. We also used HPLC to analyze vitamin A uptake mediated by STRA6 (Fig. 2, D to H). In this assay, untranfected COS-1 cells accumulated little retinyl ester. COS-1 cells transfected with LRAT alone did accumulate a small amount of retinyl esters, but cells cotransfected with STRA6 and LRAT showed a 15-fold higher amount of retinyl ester accumulation than that of cells transfected with LRAT alone (Fig. 2, D to F). At the saturating retinol-RBP concentration (0.44 1/2M) used for the HPLC assays, the amount of retinol taken up by cells in 1 hour is about 14 times the moles of RBP bound to the cell surface at steady state. Holo-RBP in the blood is in complex with the thyroxine binding protein, transthyretin (TTR). Although TTR blocks the vitamin A exit site in the holo-RBP-TTR complex (29), the fact that tissues take up vitamin A from holo-RBP-TTR in the blood in vivo suggests that TTR cannot completely inhibit tissue vitamin A uptake from holo-RBP. When we assayed vitamin A uptake by using human serum as the source of the holo-RBP-TTR complex, STRA6 could still efficiently take up vitamin A from this complex (Fig. 2, G and H).

Because retinoic acid up-regulates STRA6 in certain cancer cell lines such as WiDr human colon adenocarcinoma cells (24, 30), we used WiDr cells as an independent model to study vitamin A uptake mediated by STRA6. We increased STRA6 expression in WiDr cells by retinoic acid treatment and decreased its expression by RNA interference (RNAi). Consistent with STRA6's function in mediating vitamin A uptake from holo-RBP, its increased expression by retinoic acid treatment enhanced vitamin A uptake activity, whereas its decreased expression by specific RNAi knockdown suppressed vitamin A uptake activity (Fig. 3A). In addition, we performed RNAi knockdown experiments on primary bovine RPE cultures. Again a decrease in STRA6 expression suppressed RPE'svitamin A uptake activity from holo-RBP (Fig. 3B).

Because STRA6 is not homologous to any protein of known function and has never been characterized at the structural level, we used an unbiased strategy to test the effects of mutations on STRA6 function. We produced and characterized 50 random missense mutants of STRA6 and found that 3 of them have substantial loss of vitamin A uptake activity (Fig. 3, C to E). The locations of these mutations in the putative transmembrane topology model of STRA6 are shown in fig. S1B. Mutants 2 and 3 (M2 and M3) were not expressed at the cell surface, which may be sufficient to account for the dramatic loss of RBP binding and vitamin A uptake activity from holo-RBP. Mutant 1 (M1) was normally expressed at the cell surface but had substantially reduced RBP binding and vitamin A uptake activity. The loss of RBP binding for M1 may account for its lower vitamin A uptake activity.Characterization of STRA6-mediated vitamin A uptake from holo-RBP. We found that STRA6-mediated vitamin A uptake is specific to RBP. STRA6 could not enhance cellular uptake of vitamin A when vitamin A was bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) or -lactoglobulin (Fig. 4A). STRA6-mediated vitamin A uptake was saturable with regard to retinol-RBP concentration (Fig. 4B and fig. S2). A variety of studies from the past 3 decades had indicated that endocytosis is not required for RBP receptor-mediated vitamin A uptake from holo-RBP (14-17, 20, 22, 25). In agreement with these studies, metabolic inhibitors that effectively inhibited endocytosis did not inhibit STRA6-mediated vitamin A uptake by STRA6-transfected COS-1 cells or retinoic acid-stimulated WiDr cells (Fig. 4C and 4D). Membranes prepared from transfected cells have vitamin A uptake activity similar to that of live cells (Fig. 4E). The robust activity of this cell-free system also argues against an endocytosis-based mechanism. We also designed an assay that monitored both RBP and vitamin A that remains bound to RBP in the culture medium after cellular vitamin A uptake. We purified the RBP in the cell culture medium after cellular uptake of vitamin A and measured the absorption spectrum of the purified RBP (Fig. 4F). A preferential decrease in the vitamin A peak for RBP taken from the medium of STRA6- and LRAT-transfected cells again argued against an endocytosis-based mechanism.

(F) RBP remains outside the cell after STRA6-mediated vitamin A uptake from holo-RBP for 8 hours. Absorption spectra of RBP that remains in the supernatant of untransfected cells (left) and cells transfected with STRA6 and LRAT (right) are shown. Localization of STRA6 is consistent with its function as the RBP receptor. The tissue localization of STRA6 has been studied previously (24). STRA6 is expressed during embryonic development and in the adult brain, spleen, kidney, female genital tract, and testis (and at lower quantities in heart and lung). Furthermore, STRA6 is highly enriched in the RPE in the adult eye (24). To further study the location of STRA6 in adult organs, we produced polyclonal antibodies against bovine STRA6 and performed immunohistochemistry on several adult organs. In the RPE, STRA6 is localized to the basolateral membrane (Fig. 5, A to C), a location consistent with its role in interacting with RBP in the choriocapillaris blood (14). In contrast to its absence in the endothelial cells of the choriocapillaris (Fig. 5, A and B), STRA6 was expressed in retinal blood vessels, another location of the blood-retina barrier (Fig. 5, D and E). Holo-RBP from retinal blood vessels is a potential source of vitamin A for Muller cells in the retina (31). In addition to blood-brain barriers as observed in a previous study (24), we found STRA6 expression in astrocyte perivascular endfeet that surround blood vessels negative for STRA6 (Fig. 5F). In accord with National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)'s expressed sequence tag (EST) tissue expression profile for STRA6, we observed STRA6 expression in the placenta (Fig. 5G) and the spleen (Fig. 5H).

Discussion. The existence of an RBP receptor is supported by a large body of evidence. The absence of vitamin A from abundant erythrocytes and serum albumin, which can bind vitamin A, argues against simple diffusion of retinol from the RBP to the cell membrane as the mechanism of vitamin A delivery by RBP (32). The fact that free vitamin A can diffuse through membranes is not a good argument against the existence of an RBP receptor. First, nearly all vitamin A in blood is bound to the soluble RBP-TTR complex, which cannot freely pass through cell membranes. Second, there are known examples of molecules that can diffuse through membranes but still depend on membrane transporters to facilitate their transport. For example, prostaglandin can pass the membrane by simple diffusion, but prostaglandin transporter greatly facilitates its transport across membranes (33). In addition, there is strong experimental evidence supporting the existence of an RBP receptor that mediates cellular vitamin A uptake (13-23). This study has identified STRA6 as the RBP receptor. The RBP-STRA6 system represents a small-molecule delivery mechanism that involves an extracellular carrier protein but does not depend on endocytosis. Given the potent biological effects (including toxicity) of vitamin A and its derivatives (2-4), a controlled release of vitamin A into cells from holo-RBP through STRA6 has an evolutionary advantage over nonspecific diffusion of vitamin A. This mechanism makes it possible to achieve high efficiency and specificity for vitamin A delivery to organs distant from the liver such as the eye, brain, placenta, and testis.STRA6's localization in adult brain is consistent with vitamin A's roles in regulating adult brain activities (34), such as synaptic plasticity (35) and cortical synchrony during sleep (36). STRA6 expression in the placenta and testis is consistent with the role of RBP in delivering vitamin A to these tissues (11, 12). STRA6 expression in the spleen and thymus is consistent with a role for vitamin A in immune regulation and in prevention against infectious disease (8, 37). According to NCBI's EST analysis, STRA6 is also expressed in human skin and lung, both known to depend on vitamin A for proper function (38, 39). Undifferentiated human skin keratinocytes were found to have the highest RBP binding activity of any cell or tissue types tested (18). The absence or very low expression of STRA6 in the liver(24) makes physiological sense. Liveris the major site of production of vitamin A-loaded RBP to deliver vitamin A to peripheral organs. If STRA6 was highly expressed in the liver and absorbed vitamin A from holo-RBP produced by liver itself, a short circuit would be created.STRA6 was originally found to be a retinoic acid-stimulated gene in cancer cell lines (24, 30). However, it is possible that there are certain noncancer cell types that respond to retinoic acid to stimulate STRA6 expression. For example, vitamin A combined with retinoic acid increases retinol uptake in the lung in a synergistic manner (40), consistent with the ability of retinoic acidtostimulate STRA6 expression. Onestudy found that STRA6 was overexpressed up to 172-fold in 14 out of 14 human colorectal tumors relative to the normal colon tissue (30). Thus, the RBP-STRA6 system not only functions as a physiological mechanism of vitamin A uptake, but also potentially participates in pathological processes such as insulin resistance (6) and cancer.
AbstractA central issue in the regulation of apoptosis by the Bcl-2 family is whether its BH3-only members initiate apoptosis by directly binding to the essential cell-death mediators Bax and Bak, or whether they can act indirectly, by engaging their pro-survival Bcl-2-like relatives. Contrary to the direct-activation model, we show that Bax and Bak can mediate apoptosis without discernable association with the putative BH3-only activators (Bim, Bid, and Puma), even in cells with no Bim or Bid and reduced Puma. Our results indicate that BH3-only proteins induce apoptosis at least primarily by engaging the multiple pro-survival relatives guarding Bax and Bak.Whether a cell dies in response to diverse developmental cues or cellular stresses is determined largely by interactions between three factions of the Bcl-2 protein family (1). Two factions promote apoptosis: The BH3-only proteins (including Bim, Bid, Puma, Bad, and Noxa) sense cellular damage, and Bax and Bak are critical downstream mediators of apoptosis because their combined absence abolishes most apoptotic responses (2, 3). When activated, Bax and Bak permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane, freeing proapoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c, which promote activation of the proteases (caspases) that mediate cellular demolition. Activation of Bax and Bak is opposed by the pro-survival faction: Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1. These guardians are inactivated when BH3-only proteins insert their BH3 domain into a groove on the pro-survival proteins (1).Awidely embraced model for the initiation of apoptosis (4) (Fig. 1A) proposes that a subset of BH3-only proteins termed "activators"-namely Bim and Bid (4-6) and, perhaps, Puma (7)-directly engage Bax or Bak. The other BH3-only proteins, termed "sensitizers" (for example, Bad and Noxa), purportedly act only by displacing the activators from the pro-survival proteins, allowing the activators to bind Bax and Bak. An alternative indirect model (8, 9) (Fig. 1A), supported here, posits that BH3-only proteins activate Bax or Bak not by binding either one but indirectly, by engaging the multiple pro-survival relatives that constrain them. In this scenario, Bim, Bid, and Puma are highly potent because they engage all pro-survival proteins, whereas the others are less so because they bind only selective subsets (8).

(C) Coimmunoprecipitation tests in Triton X-100-containing lysates of healthy thymocytes (-) or 24 hours after treatment with ionomycin (+), a Bim-dependent stimulus (14). Bim-containing complexes, isolated using an antibody (3C5) that recognizes all Bim isoforms, were examined for Bax, Bcl-2, or Mcl-1 (upper three panels). Control, isotype-matched antibody immunoprecipitation; WCL, whole-cell lysates; IP, immunoprecipitation. We first investigated whether BH3 peptides associate with Bax in vitro (10). The Bim and Bid BH3 peptides failed to bind native Bax (fig. S1A), and even a large excess of the Bim peptide did not promote Bax oligomerization (fig. S2). In non-ionic detergents that alter the Bax conformation (fig. S3) (11), perhaps mimicking an activation step, they did bind (fig. S1A). However, their affinities for Bax (in the micromolar range) (Fig. 1B) appeared to be lower than those (in the nanomolar range) for the pro-survival proteins (8) (fig. S1C). Thus, Bim and Bid peptides bound weakly and only after Bax had changed conformation. No other BH3 peptide, including that of Puma, bound even to activated Bax (Fig. 1B).Coimmunoprecipitation studies extended these observations to full-length BH3-only proteins in cell lysates (fig. S4) (10). In lysates of human embryonic kidney 293T cells prepared with the detergent Triton X-100, BH3-only proteins bound to Bcl-2 or other pro-survival proteins (8) but not to endogenous Bak (fig. S4). Similarly, in lysates made with CHAPS, a detergent that maintains Bax as a soluble monomer (11), no BH3-only protein bound Bax. In Triton X-100 lysates, Bax did bind detectably to the truncated Bid (tBid) produced by caspases, but not to full-length Bid (fig. S4A), which has its BH3 domain buried (12). BimEL and BimL, the only Bim isoforms detectable in multiple cell types (fig. S5), failed to bind Bax (fig. S4B) (13), though both killed cells efficiently (8). Bax did bind the very minor BimS isoform (fig. S4B) and some unusual Bim variants confined to certain primates (fig. S6). However, no Bax was detectable in endogenous Bim protein complexes (Fig. 1C), even those from mouse thymocytes treated with ionomycin, which kills via a Bim-dependent pathway (14). In contrast, the binding of Bim to endogenous pro-survival proteins was evident, and this binding increased after cellular insults (Fig. 1C) (15, 16). Thus, Bim did not form physiologically relevant complexes with Bax or Bak.To test whether cell killing by tBid or BimS requires their binding to Bax, we used a mutation, glycine to alanine [Gly94 Ala94 (G94A)], within their BH3 domains that abrogated binding to Bax but not to the pro-survival proteins (Fig. 2 and figs. S7 to S9). Despite its inability to bind Bax, tBid G94A killed mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and mouse myeloid cells as effectively as the wild-type protein, in both short-term viability (figs. S7 and S9) and clonogenic (Fig. 2B) assays. Our studies with MEFs lacking Bax or Bak (fig. S9) showed that either Bak or Bax could mediate the killing. Furthermore, the Bid G94A BH3 peptide, like the wild-type peptide, promoted cytochrome c release from mitochondria in vitro (Fig. 2C) (10). The equivalent BimS mutant gave similar results (figs. S8 and S9). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2. Binding to Bax is not required for killing by tBid.

(B) Colony formation 6 days after plating of equivalent numbers of retrovirally infected MEFs (10), normalized to the number of colonies formed with the parental retrovirus. Data represent means SD from three independent experiments. (C) Cytochrome c release elicited by BH3 peptides. Permeabilized MEFs incubated with each BH3 peptide (10 1/2M) were separated into soluble (s) and sedimented (p, pellet) fractions that were probed with antibodies to cytochrome c, Bak (membrane marker), or HSP70 (cytosolic marker). Thus, tBid and Bim can induce apoptosis without binding Bax or Bak. We inferred that these proteins and their G-to-A mutants caused cell death by binding to and neutralizing diverse pro-survival proteins (8). Indeed, the corresponding glycine-to-glutamate mutants, which do not bind most (or any) pro-survival family members, did not kill (Fig. 2 and figs. S7 to S9).If Bim and Bid [the major candidate activator BH3-only proteins (4-6)] were essential for apoptosis, as the direct-activation model implies, mice lacking both proteins (10) should exhibit developmental abnormalities, like Bax-Bak-deficient animals, which usually die as neonates (2). Instead, mice lacking both Bim and Bid were born at the expected Mendelian frequency (fig. S10), appeared normal (e.g., no webbing between the toes), and remained healthy for over 12 months. Moreover, comparison of the sensitivity to DNA damage of immortalized MEFs from Bim-Bid double-knockout (DKO), wild-type, or Bax-Bak DKO embryos (fig. S11) revealed that, whereas Bax-Bak deficiency conferred resistance to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and etoposide, the absence of both Bim and Bid neither abrogated apoptosis nor prevented Bax activation (Fig. 3, A and B).

Data in (A) and (D) represent means SD from three independent experiments. Because the direct-activation model (Fig. 1A) proposes that only an activator BH3-only protein can kill cells, we tested whether the sensitizers Bad and Noxa (4) could kill cells lacking both Bim and Bid. Although overexpression of Bad and Noxa together killed wild-type MEFs (8) and neither bound Bax or Bak (Fig. 1B and fig. S4C), we could not exclude the possibility that they killed by displacing endogenous Bim or tBid. However, even in the absence of both Bim and Bid, the Noxa-Bad combination (Fig. 3, C to E), which neutralizes all four pro-survival proteins expressed in MEFs (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1), still induced apoptosis and cytochrome c release in vitro, as did the Bad-like BH3 mimetic ABT-737 (17) plus Noxa (fig. S12). Mouse liver mitochondria yielded similar results (fig. S13).Although one study reported that Puma bound Bax (7), its putative activator role is disputed (5, 6). We and others (18) have detected no association of Puma with Bax or Bak (Fig. 1B and fig. S4C). Nevertheless, to assess whether Puma has any role as an activator, we decreased Puma expression with RNA interference in bim-/-bid-/- MEFs (fig. S14). As expected (19), its reduction impaired etoposide-induced death. Nevertheless, in cells retaining only a small amount of Puma and no Bim or Bid, the Noxa-ABT-737 combination still efficiently provoked apoptosis and cytochrome c release (fig. S14).We conclude that BH3-only proteins can initiate apoptosis without binding Bax or Bak, although the cooperativity with Bax of tBid (or of a stapled Bid BH3 peptide) in lysing protein-free liposomes (5, 20, 21) may indicate that direct activation contributes under some circumstances. We (8, 9) and others (22) have suggested that all BH3-only proteins function by engaging their pro-survival relatives and overcoming their block to Bax or Bak activation (Fig. 1A). Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL (but not Bcl-2) can constrain Bak by sequestering it, because enforced coexpression of Bad (to target Bcl-xL) and Noxa (to target Mcl-1) elicited Bak-dependent apoptosis without any additional stimulus (9).Which of the multiple pro-survival proteins that can bind Bax (fig. S15A) can functionally restrain it? Mcl-1 must, because neutralizing Mcl-1 by enforced Noxa expression rendered MEFs containing only Bax (Bak KO cells) sensitive to the Bad BH3 mimetic ABT-737 (Fig. 4A), which inactivates Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w (17). To identify other pro-survival antagonists of Bax (10), we used Noxa mutant m3, which binds Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, but not Bcl-2 (8) (Fig. 4B). It kills cells expressing only Bak (9), but not Bax-expressing ones (i.e., Bak KO cells) (Fig. 4B). Because Noxa m3 spares Bcl-2, Bcl-2 is implicated as another check on Bax. We tested this hypothesis using a functional Bax mutant [Lys64 Ala64 (K64A)] (fig. S15, C and D) that loses Bcl-2 binding but still binds the other pro-survival proteins (fig. S15B). The ability of Noxa m3 to kill MEFs that express K64A but not wild-type Bax (Fig. 4C) confirms that Bcl-2 can prevent Bax activation. Hence, Bax is held in check by Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and either Bcl-xL or Bcl-w, or by all four (Fig. 4D). Genetically, both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL can constrain Bax, because its concomitant loss precludes the lymphoid hypoplasia (23) or neuronal apoptosis (24) caused by their respective deficiencies. Thus, whereas only certain pro-survival proteins keep Bak in check (9), all of these proteins probably inhibit Bax (Fig. 4D). Presumably, they bind a "primed" conformer of Bak or Bax-a form that may normally be present at low levels or may be formed early in apoptotic signaling.

Until inhibited by BH3 ligands, the indicated pro-survival proteins can sequester primed Bak or Bax (possibly a form with its BH3 exposed) on intracellular membranes. Data in (A) to (C) represent means SD from three independent experiments. Our findings emphasize that the central role of the mammalian pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins, like their virally encoded orthologs (25), is to inhibit Bax and Bak (Fig. 4D) (8, 9). Thus, BH3-only proteins trigger apoptosis indirectly through Bax or Bak by neutralizing all of the relevant pro-survival proteins, allowing the activation of Bax and Bak to proceed.
AbstractThe bacterium Myxococcus xanthus has two motility systems: S motility, which is powered by type IV pilus retraction, and A motility, which is powered by unknown mechanism(s). We found that A motility involved transient adhesion complexes that remained at fixed positions relative to the substratum as cells moved forward. Complexes assembled at leading cell poles and dispersed at the rear of the cells. When cells reversed direction, the A-motility clusters relocalized to the new leading poles together with S-motility proteins. The Frz chemosensory system coordinated the two motility systems. The dynamics of protein cluster localization suggest that intracellular motors and force transmission by dynamic focal adhesions can power bacterial motility.During the exhibition of gliding motility, bacteria move across solid surfaces without the use of flagella (1). Gliding motility is important for biofilm formation and bacterial virulence. Motility in Myxococcus xanthus, a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium, relies on two separate but coordinated motility engines. S motility is powered by type IV pili that are assembled at the leading cell pole; movement is produced as the pili bind to surface exopolysaccharides and are retracted, thereby pulling the cell forward (2). A motility, on the other hand, is not associated with pili or other obvious structures and is not well understood.To investigate the A-motility system, we studied AglZ, a protein that is essential for A motility but dispensable for S motility (fig. S1, A and B) (3). AglZ is similar to FrzS, an S-motility protein that oscillates from one cell pole to the other when cells reverse direction (4) (fig. S1A). To track the localization of AglZ in moving cells, we constructed an M. xanthus strain containing a chimeric aglZ-yfp gene in place of the endogenous aglZ gene (fig. S2A). This chimeric gene encodes an AglZ-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion protein that was stable and functional (fig. S2, B and C). We followed AglZ-YFP localization using time-lapse video microscopy: In fully motile cells, AglZ-YFP was localized in ordered clusters spanning the cell length; in stalled cells, it was localized at the leading cell pole (fig. S3).To study the link between the localization of AglZ-YFP and motility, we focused our observations on AglZ-YFP in fully motile cells. These cells showed an ordered array of AglZ-YFP clusters spanning the cell body (Fig. 1A). As cells moved forward, AglZ-YFP clusters maintained fixed positions with respect to the agar substrate rather than to their relative positions in the cell (Fig. 1A). We analyzed the clusters by taking line scans of the fluorescence intensity along motility paths for successive movie frames (Fig. 1B). To identify the position of peaks in multiple frames, we calculated a thresholded line-scan average (Fig. 1B) (5). This analysis not only located the positions of clusters shown in Fig. 1A, but also had the sensitivitytofindother commonpeaks that were difficult to identify when viewing images with the eye. In every cell that was examined (n = 30), the AglZ-YFP clusters remained fixed relative to the substratum. The only AglZ-YFP clusters that moved relative to the cell body were located at the leading pole, which suggests that new sites were assembled at that pole. The number of clusters per cell was dependent on cell length; clusters were disassembled when they reached the rear half of the cell (fig. S4).

(C) Quantitative analysis of the AglZ-YFP fluorescence distribution in moving cells. The autocorrelation function of the thresholded line scan from six moving cells was averaged and displayed. (D) Power spectral density of the autocorrelation function. We calculated the autocorrelation function of the line-scan averages from six different moving cells (Fig. 1C). Autocorrelations are useful for finding repeating patterns in a signal, such as the determination of the presence of periodicities buried under noise. The average of all six autocorrelation functions displayed a clear periodicity (Fig. 1C), represented by a single large peak at a spatial frequency of 2.15 0.03 1/2m-1 in its power spectral density (Fig. 1D). This frequency corresponded to a spatial periodicity of 466 7 nm, which is very similar to the helical pitch of bacterial actin MreB as seen in both Bacillus subtilis [470 nm (6)] and Escherichia coli [460 80 nm (7)].Because AglZ-YFP clusters remained fixed relative to the substratum as cells moved forward, they must be moving in the opposite direction to that of the cell. These dynamics suggest the formation of cytoskeleton-anchored transient surface adhesions that could power cellular movement. We analyzed cells that bend while in motion to investigate whether AglZ-YFP clusters could indicate sites of transient adhesion between the cell surface and the substratum. First, in a moving cell that was progressively bending, two distinct sites of curvature were observed (Fig. 2A). If AglZ-YFP localizes at sites that mediate adhesion with the substratum, then clusters should accumulate at sites of maximum bending. As expected, accumulation of AglZ-YFP was specifically observed at each site. Second, cells sometimes became stuck at their leading end, which prevented forward movement; these cells bent into U or S shapes as the active A engine pushed against the flexible cell wall. It has been proposed that these flailing motions are due to a motor pushing from the lagging end of the cell (8). However, if multiple motor-coupled adhesion complexes pushed cells forward, flailing would also occur. In that situation, cell bends would form between adhesion complexes. In a flailing cell expressing AglZ-YFP (Fig. 2B), as the front of the cell became fixed, the still-motile cell adopted a right-handed U shape and then relaxed to adopt a left-handed U shape that transitioned into an S shape to become a right-handed U shape again (neighboring cells probably block full relaxation between 2 to 3 min and 8 to 9 min). Cell shape correlated with the pattern of AglZ-YFP clusters. At each bend, enlarged AglZ-YFP fluorescence clusters were not observed at the maximum inflection points, but rather between the bends. The fluorescent clusters maintained relatively fixed positions with respect to the agar substrate, whereas the cell body appeared to move through them (Fig. 2, B and C). Furthermore, as the AglZ-YFP clusters faded and dispersed at the lagging cell pole, terminal cell bends relaxed and a spike in velocity was observed, which suggest that dispersal of the AglZ-YFP clusters indeed removed adhesion constraints (Fig. 2C). Thus, the cell body appears to move through "focal adhesion" sites where AglZ-YFP accumulates. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

(Bottom) The relative fluorescence intensity of each cluster over time. The same color code as that used in the middle panel applies. The dynamics of AglZ-YFP localization (Fig. 1A) suggest that A-engine clusters are assembled at the leading cell pole and disassembled at the lagging end. It follows then that, during cellular reversals, proteins of the A-motility system should be shifted to the new leading pole along with S-motility components (4). Indeed, upon cellular reversal, AlgZ-YFP localized rapidly to the new leading pole (Fig. 3A and table S2). This was a two-step process: Immediately before reversal, the cell paused for 10 s, and AglZ-YFP became diffuse (Fig. 3B). The cell then reversed, and AglZ-YFP localized to the new leading pole after a 10-s delay. Thus, AglZ may not trigger polar switching, but rather might be assembled at the new leading pole along with other motility components.

The relative fluorescence intensities of each cell pole were measured in arbitrary units and plotted over time. The black line indicates the initial leading pole, and the gray line indicates the initial trailing pole. The Frz chemosensory pathway, which regulates cell reversals, controls FrzS translocation to the leading pole when cells reverse direction (4). In a nonreversing frzE mutant, AglZ-YFP localization never switched poles. In contrast, a hyper-reversing frzCDc mutant showed very frequent reversals that were always followed by AglZ-YFP polar switching (Fig. 3, C and D, and table S2). In this frzCDc strain, AglZ-YFP was mostly polar in distribution, and ordered intracellular fluorescence clusters were only observed transiently. Thus, cellular reversals result from the concerted switching of both A- and S-motility components to the new leading pole (4). Coordination of these two engines must be achieved through the signaling activity of a common pathway.Although AglZ-YFP localized to transient adhesion sites, it is unclear whether the force that produces locomotion is generated at those sites. To address this question, we investigated the motility of cells treated with the antibiotic cephalexin. Cephalexin-treated cells, which elongate up to 10 times their natural length, showed almost normal A motility but greatly reduced S motility, which suggests that the A engine is distributed along the cell body whereas the S engine is polar (9). We also observed that 10- to 30-1/2m-long A+S--motile cephalexin-treated cells moved with velocities that were independent of cell length. The localization of AglZ-YFP was also correlated with the activity of the A engine in these cells (Fig. 4A). In these moving filaments, AglZ-YFP was localized in clusters that were distributed in the front part of the cell, whereas the back of the cell was largely depleted of clusters (Fig. 4A); consequently, the number of clusters per cell was largely independent of cell length (Fig. 4B). Thus, in the filaments, we could test whether force was produced at the sites where AglZ-YFP accumulates by analyzing the relationship between the number of sites and the "drag force overcome" [i.e., the force necessary to power the motility of a cell of given cell length and velocity (5)]. Indeed, the drag force overcome was proportional to the number of clusters in filamentous cells (Fig. 4C), indicating that motility force seems to be produced at the adhesion sites; these characteristics are similar to eukaryotic focal adhesions where both adhesion and force are generated (10).

(C) Relationship between relative drag force overcome and cluster number in filamentous cells. Previously, a "slime gun" model for gliding motility was proposed because, in several bacterial species, motility is correlated with the secretion of slime through pores (nozzles) located in the outer membrane (11, 12), and a biophysical model suggested that the hydration of slime within the nozzles could generate sufficient force to propel bacteria forward (11). Our results are consistent with an alternate model, whereby intracellular motor complexes that connect to both membrane-spanning adhesion complexes and to the cytoskeleton power motility by pushing against the substratum and moving the cell body forward, much like focal adhesion-based traction or apicomplexan gliding motility in eukaryotic organisms (fig. S5) (10, 13). The periodicity of the AglZ-YFP clusters strongly implies the existence of a continuous helical filament that spans the length of the cell. Thus, the action of the motor complexes may induce the cell body to rotate as it pulls the cell forward (fig. S5). Rotation of the cell body as cells move has been shown for Cytophaga sp., an organism that also secretes slime during motility (14). Slime secretion may be part of the motility system, by supplying additional power for movement and/or adhesion or lubrication of the interface between the cell body and the substratum (10). The dynamics of AglZ-YFP and FrzS-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein (4) suggest how the A and S engines might be coordinated: A and S complexes oscillate so that they are targeted together to the new leading pole upon cellular reversal, which is synchronized by the Frz chemosensory system.
AbstractFlying insects have evolved sophisticated sensory capabilities to achieve rapid course control during aerial maneuvers. Among two-winged insects such as houseflies and their relatives, the hind wings are modified into club-shaped, mechanosensory halteres, which detect Coriolis forces and thereby mediate flight stability during maneuvers. Here, we show that mechanosensory input from the antennae serves a similar role during flight in hawk moths, which are four-winged insects. The antennae of flying moths vibrate and experience Coriolis forces during aerial maneuvers. The antennal vibrations are transduced by individual units of Johnston's organs at the base of their antennae in a frequency range characteristic of the Coriolis input. Reduction of the mechanical input to Johnston's organs by removing the antennal flagellum of these moths severely disrupted their flight stability, but reattachment of the flagellum restored their flight control. The antennae thus play a crucial role in maintaining flight stability of moths.When performing complex three-dimensional maneuvers, it is necessary for flying organisms to assess their self-motion and to respond to unintended perturbations with a rapid modulation of their wing motion (1, 2). Among winged insects, diverse strategies have evolved to resolve this problem. Insects, such as dragonflies, that typically operate under brightly lit conditions may accomplish course control primarily using visual input to modulate their motor output (3). However, for insects flying under low-light conditions, the longer latency of visual processing (4) means that it may not be possible for such insects to rely entirely on their visual systems to assess self-motion to generate rapid maneuvers.In Diptera, rapid acquisition of self-motion information is accomplished by halteres, club-shaped sensory structures that are evolutionarily derived from the hind wings and oscillate at wing beat frequency (5). The halteres and their underlying sensory neurons transduce information about pitch, roll, and yaw maneuvers to the central nervous system (5-9). Although a single muscle actively powers haltere motion with a fixed phase relation to the wing, the overall dynamics of the haltere motion are dictated primarily by its natural frequency (5). During rotational maneuvers, Coriolis (or gyroscopic) forces on the halteres cause a lateral deviation in their plane of motion (5, 9). Because the planes of oscillation of the two halteres are nonorthogonal, this system can unambiguously distinguish between pitch, roll, or yaw rotations (9). Although the haltere system has received much attention because it addresses the problem of rapid course control in Dipteran flight, fewer studies have examined how non-Dipteran insects (10, 11), especially those flying under the poorly lit conditions that make visual stabilization difficult, might achieve similar maneuvering feats.Our investigations suggest that in the crepuscular hawk moth Manduca sexta, which is four-winged and thus lacks halteres, the antennal mechanosensory system mediates flight stability using a mechanism similar to the halteres in Diptera. All winged insects, including moths and butterflies, possess a pair of annulated antennae (Fig. 1, A and B). Two sets of antennal mechanosensors are present on the basal antennal segments called the scape and pedicel (Fig. 1B). One set, called the Bohm's bristles, is present as fields of sensory hairs on the scape and the pedicel. In hawk moths, these fields are roughly opposite each other on each segment and roughly orthogonal to each other between two segments. The second set, called the Johnston's organ, is composed of circumferentially arranged mechanosensory stretch receptors called scolopidia. Each scolopidium is innervated by a bipolar neuron (12), which sends its axon down the length of the antennal nerve into the brain of the moth. The head-scape and scape-pedicel joints each consist of extrinsic (not shown) and intrinsic muscles, respectively (Fig. 1B), which drive all active antennal movements.

(C) Antennal kinematics reconstructed from three-dimensional coordinates obtained from high-speed films of hovering moths. The figure shows data from points digitized in 2048 frames (4.1 s of actual flight or >100 wing beats). The motion of the left antenna (gray) and right antenna (black) is shown with the origin centered at the head of the moth. In the spherical system, the envelope encloses a net displacement of 1/214 (0.254 rad) and 16 (0.291 rad) along the angle, and 1/219 (0.331 rad) and 22 (0.379 rad) along the angle, for the left and right antenna, respectively. (D) Antennal motions along the orthogonal and angles. For the left antenna (gray), the pitch axis points in the opposite direction. Hence, the value of is shown after subtracting from its actual value relative to the right-handed pitch-roll-yaw coordinate system. (E) Fourier decomposition of the mean offset removed movement of the right antenna for the , angles. The sharp peaks indicate that antennae vibrate at a wing beat frequency of 27 Hz (asterisk). The amplitude of the vibration was conservatively estimated to be 1.4 and 0.8 along the and angles, respectively. The antennal anatomy of M. sexta is common to most free-living insects (12). Data from silk moths (13) and butterflies (14) suggest that the Bohm's bristles encode the gross changes in antennal position, whereas the Johnston's organ responds to small, high-frequency motions of the antenna (15) such as vibrations due to sound or air flow (12, 15, 16). Several reports have described the possible mechanosensory function of antennae as airflow sensors (14, 17-22). We measured the antennal motion of freely hovering M. sexta using high-speed videography (500 frames per second; Fig. 1, C and D) [(23), section S1] and found that like some other Lepidopterans [e.g., the tortoiseshell butterfly, Aglais urticae (22)], they hold their antennae at relatively constant interantennal angles (Fig. 1C) [(23), section S1]. About this fixed position, the antennae undergo small-amplitude vibrations (Fig. 1D) with relatively little change in the antennal length [(23), section S1]. The motions of the left (gray) and right (black) antenna are roughly in phase, suggesting symmetry of movement of the two antennae. Fourier transforms of these vibrations revealed prominent peaks at wing beat frequency (27 Hz; Fig. 1E). Thus, the net mechanical stimulus experienced by the antenna contains a periodic self-generated component.The cross product of the angular velocity of body rotations and linear velocity of the moth's antennal vibrations results in Coriolis torques on the antenna. For hovering and near-hovering conditions, estimates of the torques due to Coriolis and aerodynamic forces are of the same orders of magnitude, and thus Coriolis forces also represent an important component of the net mechanical stimulus to the antennae [(23), section S2]. Like the halteres in Diptera (5, 9), Coriolis torques thus cause lateral deflections of the antennae at either wing beat frequency or twice wing beat frequency during maneuvers [(23), section S3; figs. S2 to S4]. Are the mechanosensors in basal segments of the antennae sufficiently sensitive for detecting the Coriolis forces on a vibrating antenna? To answer this question, we recorded intracellularly from the axons of individual scolopidial neurons in the Johnston's organ while subjecting the flagellum to controlled vibrations using a mechanical lever system [(23), section S4; fig. S5]. We observed strong stimulus-correlated activity of scolopidial neurons in response to mechanical stimuli in the amplitude and frequency range of natural motion (Fig. 2A). The alignment of the spikes in these records over multiple trials shows that scolopidial neurons are sensitive to small-amplitude (1/21) angular deflections in the flagella-pedicel joint. In response to constant-amplitude frequency sweep (0 to 100 Hz) motion of the antenna, the scolopidial neurons tightly phase-locked with the stimulus in a narrow frequency range of 1/250 to 70 Hz. In this range, their firing rate increases linearly with the stimulus frequency (Fig. 2B). The 50- to 70-Hz window also corresponds to twice the typical range of wing beat frequency in M. sexta (20 to 30 Hz) (24) and is the expected frequency range for the Coriolis input [(23), section S3].

Peak antennal displacement ranged from 1 to 2.5 (three moths, six cells). The numbers in the side bar represent individual moths and letters represent individual cells. The trials consisted of repetitions of the 4-s-long "natural" stimulus repeated 4 or 12 times. (B) Response of an antennal scolopidium to a constant-amplitude frequency sweep from 0 to 100 Hz. A mechanical lever attached to the flagellum delivered a constant-amplitude (1/21.5 peak-to-peak) frequency sweep (0 to 100 Hz, top panel) motion to the pedicel-flagellar joint. The corresponding spike response (middle panel) was measured from the axon of a scolopidial neuron and is shown as the Gaussian-convolved firing rate (black, bottom panel). The gray band enveloping this curve shows the standard deviation of the Gaussian-convolved firing rate. The width of the narrow Gaussian window is 500 ms with a standard deviation of 31.6 ms. (C) Stimulus-response curves for scolopidial neurons. Shown are the BLGN stimulus (top panel) and Fourier transforms for the mean spike-triggered average (STA) stimulus for eight scolopidial cells from three moths (bottom panel). The input stimulus is smoothed by the use of Welch's method and normalized with respect to maximum amplitude. The response displayed as a Fourier transform of spike-triggered average for each neuron is also normalized as a ratio of its maximum response. Of the eight neurons shown here, five (black lines) show sharp peaks between 1/250 and 75 Hz and three (gray lines) show greater responses at lower frequency. (D) Anatomy of the scolopidial neurons. Scolopidia were filled with Alexa Fluor 568 (red) or Lucifer Yellow (yellow) dyes (left panel, four neurons). The soma of these bipolar neurons are situated in the joint between flagellum (FL) and pedicel (PE). SC denotes scape. The recordings shown in (B) were taken from the one of the neurons filled with Lucifer Yellow. Length of the scale bar is 100 1/2m. The neurons send their projections ipsilaterally via the antennal nerve (AN) into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC) in the deutocerebrum of the moth, on either side of the esophageal foramen (OF) (right panel). To rigorously characterize the frequency-tuning properties of the underlying sensory apparatus, we vibrated the flagellum using a band limited Gaussian noise (BLGN) waveform in a frequency window of 1/20 to 100 Hz with a -3-dB roll-off at 1/285 Hz (Fig. 2C, top panel). We measured the intracellular spike responses of the scolopidial neurons and determined the pre-spike stimulus within a 100-ms time window before the occurrence of each spike of the time record. A Fourier transform of this spike-triggered average (STA) was used to estimate the stimulus frequency most likely to generate action potentials in the scolopidial neurons (25). A subset of the recorded scolopidial neurons (five out of eight; Fig. 2C, bottom panel) showed sharp response peaks in the frequency range of 1/250 to 75 Hz and is thus capable of encoding Coriolis-driven lateral motions of the antennae during aerial maneuvers. To determine the location and projection patterns of these neurons, we filled them with fluorescent dyes after recording. In all cases, the images showed bipolar neurons innervating the scolopidia in the Johnston's organ and arborized ipsilaterally into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC) in the brain, the main site of integration of the mechanosensory signal from the antennal deflections (Fig. 2D) (26, 27).Thus, our results suggest that the antennae of M. sexta (and also perhaps other Lepidopterans) are capable of detecting the Coriolis forces generated during turning maneuvers and may be involved in flight stabilization. Does a reduction of the mechanosensory input from the antenna affect flight performance? To answer this question, we performed experiments manipulating the mechanical loading on the Johnston's organs and measured the free-flight performance of the moths via videography under low-light conditions [(23), section S5]. This study consisted of two experiments. First, we compared the flight performance of moths with intact antennae (normally loaded Johnston's organs) to that of moths with their flagella surgically removed (unloaded Johnston's organs). Second, to control other sensory influences of an intact flagellum, we compared the performance of individuals whose flagella were removed and reattached (reloaded Johnston's organs) to that of the same individuals after removing the flagella again (unloaded Johnston's organs). In all cases, the basal mechanosensory apparatus was left intact and only the flagellum was cut within a few (<10) annuli from the base. This ensured that the mechanical stimulus due to vibrating antennae was substantially reduced.To analyze the effect of the flagellar amputation on flight performance, we counted the occurrences of three types of behavior in each flight sequence: (i) collisions with the wall, (ii) crashes to the floor, and (iii) incidence of backward flight (typically spanning the entire width of the flight chamber) [(23), sections S5 to S7]. Moths with amputated flagella could take flight, but had a significantly higher frequency of backward flight than intact moths [(23), section S7; Fig. 3A]. These moths also crashed [(23), section S7; Fig. 3B] and collided [(23), section S7; Fig. 3C] with the walls significantly more frequently than moths with intact flagella (P < 0.02). These results indicate that intact flagella are necessary for stable flight in M. sexta. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3. Free-flight behavior of moths with and without antennal mechanosensory input. Data from behavioral experiments are represented as notched, whisker plots. The bottom and top of the box show lower and upper quartile values, respectively. The horizontal black line within the box represents the median for each category. Whiskers include the most extreme data value up to 1.5 times the interquartile range. The outlier points beyond this range are shown by the + symbol. Nonoverlapping notches indicate different medians at the 5% significance level. Top row shows data for backward flight, middle row for crashes, and bottom row for collisions. The left column (A to C) shows behavior of moths with intact antennae versus amputated flagella (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P = 0.002). The right column (D to F) shows behavior of moths with reattached flagella versus reamputated flagella (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P = 0.0156). The flagella of most insect antennae are multisensory structures bearing odor, humidity, and temperature sensors in addition to mechanosensory bristles along the flagellum (12). Thus, in moths with amputated flagella, not only is the normal mechanical loading of Johnston's organs disrupted, but these various sensory cues are also eliminated. Which of these functions is primarily responsible for the lack of flight stability in moths with amputated flagella? To answer this question, we reattached the flagella to the basal antennal segments of the moths with glue and compared their flight performance with moths without flagella [(23), section S5]. Moths with reattached flagella were able to substantially regain flight control [(23), section S8]. In contrast, moths with no flagella flew backward significantly more often (Fig. 3D), crashed to the ground more often (Fig. 3E), and collided with walls more frequently (Fig. 3F). Because the surgical removal and reattachment of the antennal flagella with Super Glue required cold anesthesia, these moths were analyzed separately from the earlier flagella-amputated group. Moths with reattached flagella receive no input from any sensory neurons on the flagella because their antennal nerve is severed during the removal and reattachment of flagella. Thus, the restoration of normal mechanical loading of Johnston's organs is sufficient for recovery of flight control in moths with reattached flagella.In summary, our study of antennal vibrations in freely flying moths and subsequent estimates of the mechanical forces on vibrating antennae suggest that antennae experience strong Coriolis forces during aerial maneuvers. Our neurophysiological data indicate that antennal mechanosensors are tuned within the frequency range of these forces. The antennectomy experiments show that normal loading of the mechanosensors in the base of the antennae, probably the Johnston's organ, is critical for flight stability. Moths without flagella can take flight but cannot stably hover or execute controlled maneuvers. However, moths with reattached flagella regain flight control. Therefore, we propose that the antennae together with the mechanosensors in their bases are necessary for flight stability in M. sexta, similar to halteres in flies. Thesedataprovideamechanism to explain previous observations that antennectomy compromises flight in other Lepidopterans (21). Moreover, it is possible that the end knobs on the antennae of certain Lepidoptera (e.g., butterflies) and other insects (e.g., owl flies) function as a means of increasing the sensitivity to Coriolis forces by enhancing antennal vibrations during flight. Thus, these studies offer an insight into the non-haltere-mediated mechanisms for course control in flying insects and may be useful to studies of insect flight, as well as to recent efforts toward designing robotic insects.
AbstractExtensive studies are currently being performed to associate disease susceptibility with one form of genetic variation, namely, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In recent years, another type of common genetic variation has been characterized, namely, structural variation, including copy number variants (CNVs). To determine the overall contribution of CNVs to complex phenotypes, we have performed association analyses of expression levels of 14,925 transcripts with SNPs and CNVs in individuals who are part of the International HapMap project. SNPs and CNVs captured 83.6% and 17.7% of the total detected genetic variation in gene expression, respectively, but the signals from the two types of variation had little overlap. Interrogation of the genome for both types of variants may be an effective way to elucidate the causes of complex phenotypes and disease in humans.Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation in human populations is currently one of the major goals in human genetics. Gene expression (the transcription of DNA into mRNA) has been interrogated in a variety of species and experimental scenarios in order to investigate the genetic basis of variation in gene regulation (1-8), as well as to tease apart regulatory networks (9, 10). In some respects, a comprehensive survey of gene expression phenotypes (steady-state levels of mRNA) serves as a proxy for the breadth and nature of phenotypic variation in human populations (11). Much of the observed variation in mRNA transcript levels may be compensated at higher stages of regulatory networks, but an understanding of the nature of genetic variants that affect gene expression will provide an essential framework and model for elucidating the causes of other types of phenotypic variation. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have long been known to be associated with phenotypic variation either through direct causal effects or by serving as proxies for other causal variants with which they are highly correlated (i.e., in linkage disequilibrium) (1, 2, 12). An understanding of this association has been facilitated by the validation of millions of SNPs by the International HapMap project (13). However, during the last few years, structural variants, such as copy number variants (CNVs)-defined as DNA segments that are 1 kb or larger in size present at variable copy number in comparison with a reference genome (14)-have attracted much attention (2). It has become apparent that they are quite common in the human genome (15-19) and can have dramatic phenotypic consequences as a result of altering gene dosage, disrupting coding sequences, or perturbing long-range gene regulation (20, 21). Evidence has been presented that increased copy number can be positively (18, 22) or negatively (23) correlated with gene expression levels (for example, deletion of a transcriptional repressor could serve to elevate gene expression) but the relative contribution of such large genetic variants (i.e., CNVs) and smaller variants (i.e., SNPs) to phenotypic variation has not been evaluated. It is also still unknown whether SNPs can serve as proxies to CNVs (24, 25) and whether the complex nature of some CNVs requires that they be surveyed directly (26). We have used the phase I HapMap SNPs (13) and the recently described CNV data ascertained in the same HapMap populations (26) for correlation with genomewide gene expression variation in the same individuals.Gene expression was interrogated in lymphoblastoid cell lines of all 210 unrelated HapMap individuals (13) from four populations (CEU: 60 Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe; CHB: 45 Han Chinese in Beijing; JPT: 45 Japanese in Tokyo; YRI: 60 Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria) in four technical replicates (see Methods). Out of the 47,294 transcripts that were interrogated, the normalized values for 14,925 transcripts (14,072 genes) were included in the analysis [see Methods and (27)]. The SNP genotypes from phase I HapMap (28) were used in the analysis (see Methods). CNV data were represented by log2 ratios from comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of each HapMap individual against a common reference individual on an array comprising 26,574 large-insert clones covering 93.7% of the euchromatic portion of the genome (26, 29). Log2 ratios from two sets of clones were analyzed: the whole set of 24,963 autosomal clones (CGH clones) and the 1322 autosomal clones corresponding to CNVs present in at least two HapMap individuals (CNV clones) (26). We excluded genes on sex chromosomes because of their imbalance in males and females. We performed linear regression (on each of the four populations separately) between normalized quantitative gene expression values and SNP genotypes or clone log2 ratios that were near the gene (SNP position or clone midpoint within 1 Mb and 2 Mb, respectively, of the probe midpoint position). We used different window sizes for SNPs and clones because clones are large (median size of 1/2170 kb) and structural variants can exert long-range effects (21), so a 2-Mb window is more appropriate. Statistical significance was evaluated through the use of permutations (30), as previously described (1), and a corrected P value threshold of 0.001 was applied (see Methods). Repeated permutation exercises showed that our permutation thresholds were very stable (see table S1). We tested a large number of genes so an additional correction was required. This could be done either by adjusting the threshold to a new corrected threshold above which all genes are expected to be significant (e.g., Bonferroni correction) or by setting the threshold to a value that generates a satisfactory false-discovery rate (FDR). We have used the second, and we have estimated the FDR on the basis of the number of genes tested and have required that, in all cases, at least 80% of the genes called significant are estimated to be truly significant. Given that there are 14,072 genes that lie within 1 Mb of SNPs and within 2 Mb of the full set of CGH clones, and 1/27150 genes that lie within 2 Mb from the CNV clones (from 7135 to 7191 depending on the population, owing to missing data), we expect this analysis to generate false-positive association signals for approximately 14 and 7 genes, respectively, in each population.Of the 14,072 genes tested, we detected significant associations with at least one SNP for 323, 348, 370, and 411 genes for CEU, CHB, JPT, and YRI, respectively (e.g., Table 1 and table S1). These comprise a total of 888 non-redundant genes of which 331 (37%) were replicated at the same significance level in at least one other population, and of those, 67 (8%) were significant in all four populations (Table 2 and table S2). As expected, we have limited power to detect weak effects because of the small sample sizes: The minimum detected squared regression coefficient (r2)-which reflects the proportion of expression variance accounted for by the linear association with allele counts-was 0.27. However, some very strong effects were detected that, in some cases, had an r2 close to 1 (Fig. 1 and fig. S1). We detected a strong preference for associated SNPs to be close to their respective genes, most of which were within 100 kb of the interrogated expression probe (Fig. 1, A and C). In summary, we detected a large number of regions that appear to carry genetic variation affecting gene expression. To evaluate the effect of experimental variation and, hence, the robustness of our associations, we compared the list of gene expression associations from our previous study (1) in which we detected 63 expression associations significant at the 0.05 permutation threshold in the CEU population. Of those 63 expression phenotypes, 47 went into the current analysis, of which 43 (91.5%) were called significant at the same permutation threshold (0.05) in the same population. The previous study was performed with different batches of cells, by using RNA extracted in a different laboratory, with RNA levels quantified on a different type of array (custom versus genomewide array), so the high degree of experimental and statistical replication strongly suggests that the signals we detected are robust and stable to experimental variation in expression measurements.

For clone-expression associations, all clones in the window are shown; however, the significance threshold was determined by permuting data only from those clones in CNVs where the CNV was present in at least two HapMap individuals. All coordinates shown are from Build 35 of the human genome. Inset panels show the relation between mRNA levels and SNP genotypes or clone log2 ratios, for the most significant clone or SNP in that population, which may differ across populations. Little prior data exists on CNV-expression associations against which to compare and demonstrate the robustness of our associations. One recent study (18) demonstrated three associations between common deletions and gene expression in a subset of the CEU. Two of these deletions are covered by our CGH data. The reported expression association caused by the largest of these two deletions is also captured in our analysis (influencing UGT2B17), and we extend this observation to show that this deletion also affects the expression of three other nearby genes (UGT2B7, UGT2B10, and UGT2B11) and that these associations replicate across all four populations. The smaller deletion of only 18 kb, reported previously (18) as affecting expression of GSTM1, is below the expected resolution of the CGH data. Nonetheless, we observe an association that, although it does not pass our stringent permutation threshold (0.001), has significant nominal P values in all four populations (PCEU = 0.0292; PYRI = 0.0018; PJPT = 0.0408; PCHB = 0.0185). This suggests that effects of CNVs far smaller than genomic regions that met our criteria to be called a CNV within the CGH platform can be detected and replicated in multiple populations with our analysis.Having investigated the potential contribution of CNV to variation in gene expression by using data from all CGH clones, we interrogated the nature of CNV effects on gene expression in finer detail by performing association tests of 1322 clones within high confidence CNVs (see above) with expression of the 14,072 genes, in order to generate a set of high stringency associations for which the presence of an underlying CNV has already been validated. Significant associations with at least one of the 1322 CNV clones were detected for 40, 32, 40, and 42 genes in CEU, CHB, JPT, and YRI, respectively (99 nonredundant genes) (table S4). Thirty-four of the 99 genes (34%) associated with CNV clones have a significant signal in at least two populations (Table 2), of which 7 (7%) were associated in all populations. Some CNV clones were associated with more than one gene in the same population; a notable example was a single CNV clone associated with expression of four genes in all populations (UGT2B genes, see above). CNVs detected by CGH can be classified into five classes: deletion, duplication, deletion and duplication at the same locus, multiallelic, and complex (26); we find all classes of CNV represented among the significant associations. Despite the clear preference for genes to lie close to their associated CNVs (Fig. 1, B and D), 53% of the expression probes associated with a CGH clone were located outside the CNVs encompassing that clone (26). This suggests that rather than altering gene dosage, about half the CNV effects are caused by disruption of the gene (some parts of the gene, but not the probe, are within in the CNV) or affect regulatory regions and other functional regions that have an impact on gene expression. When we extended our analysis to consider associations between genes and CNVs up to 6 Mb apart, we detected a few significant long-distance associations beyond 2 Mb (table S5). These types of long-range effects are becoming more apparent through recent studies looking in detail at specific genomic regions (20, 31). A small minority (5 to 15%) of the significant CNV-expression associations have a negative correlation between copy number and gene expression, which suggests that not all the detected effects are of the conventional type, wherein gene expression levels increase with gene copy number (table S3). Almost all (32 out of 34) of the associations that are shared between populations also exhibit the same direction of correlation in all populations. The two exceptions could result from the CNVs being in linkage disequilibrium with different regulatory variants in different populations or because of SNP * CNV interactions. However, the strong bias toward positive correlations between copy number and expression levels implies that the vast majority of these associations are attributable to the CNV itself, and not to a linked variant.We next determined whether the same associations were also captured by SNPs (Fig. 2 and figs. S3 and S4). We only considered those CGH clones or CNVs within 1 Mb of the probe so that the analysis is comparable to that of the SNPs (total of 188 and 84 genes for CGH clones and CNVs, respectively). We expect some of the CNVs to be correlated with SNPs via common genealogical history (linkage disequilibrium) and therefore their effect on gene expression would also be captured by SNP associations. Fewer than 20% (in all populations) of the detected CGH clone associations overlapped with SNP associations (Table 1), even when we included CGH and SNP associations with the same gene but in different populations [28 out of 188 (14%) genes with significant CGH clone associations also had a SNP association in any population]. The same is true of CNV clone associations: Only 15 of 84 genes (18%) with CNV clone associations within 1 Mb also had a SNP association in any population, and if we required the association in the same population, only 12 (14%) of genes had a SNP association. On the basis of previous work characterizing the patterns of linkage disequilibrium around CNVs (26), we considered that this low overlap between CNVor CGH clone associations with SNP associations might be due in part either to a low density of successfully genotyped SNPs around some CNVs or to the suppression of apparent LD by recurrent mutation at some CNVs. Segmental duplications (SDs) are the primary cause of low SNP densities in HapMap Phase I because of the difficulties in developing robust SNP genotyping assays within them (13). We did not observe enrichment of segmentally duplicated sequences within the CGH and CNV clones that did not share signals with SNPs relative to those CGH and CNV clones that did share signals with SNPs. However, we observe a 2.5-fold excess of compound CNVs [CNVs with more than one mutation event, on the basis of classification of the CNVs in (26)] in associations that are not shared with SNPs relative to those that are shared (Fisher's exact test: P 100 kb) copy number variation analyzed here appears to be associated with about 10 to 25% as many gene expression phenotypes as captured by 1/2700,000 SNPs, and the majority of these effects cannot be explained by altered dosage of the entire gene, but by gene disruption and its impact on the regulatory landscape of the region where these CNVs occur. When we restrict the analysis to within 1 Mb of the probe of the expressed gene, we detected 1061 genes associated with CGH clones or SNPs, 17.7% of which are associated with CGH clones, 83.6% with SNPs, and 1.3% with both. Of the 972 genes associated with CNV clones or SNPs, 8.75% are associated with CNV clones, 92.5% with SNPs, and 1.25% with both. Whereas the phase I HapMap SNPs likely capture a large fraction of the SNP effects in the genome (13), only a small minority of the CNVs in the genome were considered here: CNVs 100 kb in length (19). As a consequence, 8.75 to 17.7% is a minimal estimate of the proportion of heritable gene expression variation that is explained by copy number variation.Our study has attempted to evaluate the relative impact of CNVs and SNPs on phenotypic variation in human populations. Within the limitations of our samples, tissue type, SNP coverage, and CNV resolution, each type of genetic variation captures a substantial number of largely mutually exclusive effects on gene expression. We also demonstrate that both CNV and SNP associations are replicated across populations. Replication of association signals is the sine qua non of association studies, and the fact that we observe this even between diverse populations and with small sample sizes highlights the relevance and robustness of the associations we detect. Gene expression is the basis for many crucial functions in the cell, so the relative contribution of these two types of variants is an indication of the nature of the mutational and natural selection processes that contribute to phenotypic diversity and divergence. It is, therefore, essential that we interrogate both SNPs and CNVs (of all types) to perform a comprehensive exploration of genetic effects on phenotypic variation and disease. It is possible that, if a larger number of SNPs were analyzed or a higher resolution of CNVs was available, we would observe more overlap between the effects attributed to CNVs and SNPs. However, the difficulty of designing robust SNP genotyping assays in structurally dynamic regions of the genome (26) suggests that even with more comprehensive interrogation of SNPs and CNVs, the overlap may not be high enough for one type of variation to be sufficient for exploring the genetic causes of disease. We have also demonstrated that it is not necessary to perform such studies with CNV calls or CNV genotypes, but it is possible to use filtered CGH log2 ratios or any other type of high-quality quantitative signal that reflects underlying CNV. It has also become apparent that there are many more structural variants that contribute to phenotypic variation than our stringent criteria for what is a CNV reveal and that higher-resolution methods are necessary to elucidate their structure and function. Last, but not least, is the fact that we have only considered simple models of association in small samples, so it is very likely that if we apply more complex and realistic models (e.g., epistatic interactions) and/or larger population samples, a larger number of effects would be revealed. The results presented here reinforce the idea that the complexity of functionally relevant genetic variation ranges from single nucleotides to megabases, and the full range of the effects of all of these variants will be best captured and interpreted by complete knowledge of the sequence of many human genomes. Until this is possible we need to survey all known types of genetic variation to maximize our understanding of human evolution, diversity, and disease.
AbstractGlycoprotein G of the vesicular stomatitis virus triggers membrane fusion via a low pH-induced structural rearrangement. Despite the equilibrium between the pre- and postfusion states, the structure of the prefusion form, determined to 3.0 angstrom resolution, shows that the fusogenic transition entails an extensive structural reorganization of G. Comparison with the structure of the postfusion form suggests a pathway for the conformational change. In the prefusion form, G has the shape of a tripod with the fusion loops exposed, which point toward the viral membrane, and with the antigenic sites located at the distal end of the molecule. A large number of G glycoproteins, perhaps organized as in the crystals, act cooperatively to induce membrane merging.The Rhabdoviridae are enveloped bullet-shaped viruses that are widespread among a great variety of organisms, including plants, insects, fishes, mammals, reptiles, and crustaceans (1). This family includes vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as well as notable human pathogens, such as rabies virus (RV) and Chandipura virus (2).The rhabdoviruses enter the cell via the endocytic pathway and subsequently fuse with a cellular membrane within the acidic environment of the endosome (3). Both receptor recognition and membrane fusion are mediated by a single transmembrane (TM) viral glycoprotein (G) that is trimeric and forms the spikes that protrude from the viral surface. The large ectodomain of G (446 out of 495 amino acids for the VSV Indiana strain) is also the target of neutralizing antibodies, and the antigenic sites of G in both VSV and RV have been described in detail (4-6).Similar to other viral fusion proteins, G undergoes a fusogenic structural transition during cell entry (7, 8). As for influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), flavivirus E protein, and Semliki Forest virus E1 protein, the conformational change is triggered at low pH (9). G can adopt at least three conformational states (7, 8, 10-14): the native prefusion state detected at the viral surface above pH 7; the activated hydrophobic state, which interacts with the membrane as a first step of the fusion process (11); and the fusion-inactive postfusion conformation that is antigenically distinct from both the native and activated states. There is a pH-dependent equilibrium between the different states of G that is shifted toward the postfusion conformation at low pH (15). Thus, unlike fusogenic proteins from other viral families, the native prefusion conformation is not metastable (9). Indeed, the reversibility of the low pH-induced conformational change is essential to allow G to be transported through the acidic compartments of the Golgi apparatus and to recover its native functional state at the viral surface (16).We have recently determined the low-pH postfusion three-dimensional structure of the VSV G ectodomain (residues 1 to 422), generated by limited proteolysis of the virions with thermolysin (Gth)(17). In spite of having an unrecognized fold distinct from those of other fusion proteins previously described, the postfusion conformation of G displays the classic hairpin conformation of other viral fusogenic proteins [i.e., an elongated structure with the fusion domain and the TM domain at the same end of the molecule (18)]. As in class I fusion proteins (19-21), the postfusion trimer displays a six-helix bundle with the fusion domains at the N terminus of the central helices and the TM domains at the C terminus of the antiparallel outer helices. Each fusion domain bears two fusion loops located at the tip of an elongated sheet, which is a marked convergence with class II fusion proteins (22-24). Unexpectedly, G turned out to be homologous to glycoprotein gB of herpesviruses, the atomic structure of which was published at the same time (25). Because the low pH-induced conformational change of rhabdoviral G is reversible, it remained unclear to what extent the pre- and postfusion conformations differed for this class of fusion proteins.Among the different crystal forms obtained with Gth (17) (see also the materials and methods in the supporting online material), one of them, which was grown at pH 8.7, appeared to be particularly notable, because the asymmetric unit could not accommodate the postfusion form (125 A in length) but was consistent with the presence of one protomer of the prefusion form [8.5 nm in length as measured for the RV G ectodomain by electron microscopy (EM) (26)]. This crystal structure of Gth was determined to 3.0 A resolution by molecular replacement with the use of domains I, III, and IV (Table 1) of the low-pH form as search models. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in table S1. The structure of Gth is depicted in Fig. 1. Its length (88 A), the location of the antigenic sites, and the comparison with the low-pH structure indicate that this Gth structure corresponds to the prefusion conformation of the molecule. The chain can be traced up to residue 413 (see the electron density for the final model in fig. S1). Clear density is also present for the first residues of both oligosaccharide chains (on N163 and N320) (27), which were disordered in the structure of the low-pH form.

Each leg is composed of a fusion domain with the fusion loops pointing toward the viral membrane. The last residues that we can see (including the conserved H407 and P408) pack against the side of the fusion domain. This organization, which is reminiscent of the low-resolution structure of retroviruses' envelope spikes that was recently determined by EM (28, 29), suggests that the TM segments are separate in the membrane. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that the missing C-terminal segments of the ectodomain (residues 414 to 446) that lead to the TM segments come together toward the threefold axis.In the tripod arrangement, the fusion domains are set wide apart, keeping the fusion loops separate (Fig. 1B, left). In contrast to class I and class II fusion proteins, the fusion loops of G are not buried at an oligomeric interface in the prefusion conformation. The hydrophobic residues Y116, A117, W72, and Y73 are exposed (Fig. 1, A and B), even though they cluster near crystal contacts (fig. S3D). The tips of the fusion domains are the most flexible part of the structure (fig. S4) and thus are the least well defined in the electron density maps.The conformational change involves a dramatic reorganization of the G molecule. Figure S2 shows a comparison of the secondary structure elements of the two conformations with their nomenclature. The pre- and postfusion states are related by flipping both the fusion domain and a C-terminal segment (composed of residues 383 to 413) relative to a rigid block (RbI-II) made by the lateral domain and residues of the trimerization domain that include helix F2 of the prefusion form (Table 1 and Fig. 1B, inset). During the structural transition, both the fusion loops and the TM domain move 1/2160 A from one end of the molecule to the other. Thus, the observed conformational change, although reversible, appears to be similar to that of paramyxovirus F glycoprotein (30). It also suggests that similar intermediates are formed during the fusion-associated refolding of G, HA, and paramyxovirus F glycoprotein (19, 30). In one of these intermediates (Fig. 2C and movie S1), the fusion domain is projected at the top of the spike, allowing the initial interaction with the target membrane.

(C) Cartoon representation of the relative organization of domains with respect to the viral membrane during the conformational change. The one-sided black arrows indicate the relative movements of domains. The N- to C-terminal orientations of helices F2 (blue; left), F (blue; middle and right), and H (dark blue; right) are indicated with white arrows. Pre- (left) and postfusion (right) conformations are shown. The trimer axes are indicated. The middle cartoon shows how the fusion loops (in green) would be projected after the refolding of both the DIII-DIV hinge and the DII-DIII connection and before the C-terminal refolding of helix H. In spite of large rearrangements in their relative orientation (Fig. 2, A and B), domains I, III, and IV retain their folded structure (Table 1 and Figs. 1A and 2). In this and the following paragraphs, we describe the conformational change of a protomer by considering RbI-II as invariant (Fig. 1B, inset). The flippings of both the fusion domain and the TM segment relative to RbI-II occur through a concerted rearrangement of distinct regions of the molecule. Although we have only snapshots of the initial and final states, analysis of the two structures (see the description of movie S1 in the supporting online material) suggests a plausible sequence of events leading from pre- to postfusion conformations.The fusion domain is projected toward the target membrane through the combination of two movements (Fig. 2C): a 94 rotation around the hinge between the fusion and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (Fig. 2A) and the repositioning of the latter domain at the top of the trimerization domain (Fig. 2B). The rotation involves the reorganization of two segments (residues 47 to 52 and 173 to 180) of the polypeptide chain. In the former segment, helix A0 unfolds whereas, in the latter segment, helix C forms (Fig. 2A). Mutations M44 Vor I in RV G, which kinetically stabilize the native conformation (31), map to this region. Their location suggests that they impede the slight distortion of strands b and j of the PH domain that accompanies the movement.The trimerization domain undergoes a major refolding event during the transition between the pre- and postfusion structures (Fig. 2B). This refolding drives the repositioning of the PH domain and the flipping of the C-terminal part and involves all three segments of the trimerization domain (Fig. 1C).As a first step, central helix F2 (residues 276 to 294) is lengthened by the recruitment of a segment (made up of residues 263 to 275) to form the long helix F. The second segment that refolds is composed of residues 26 to 35, which, in the prefusion conformation, is buried in a groove of RbI-II that is closed by residues 263 to 275. A sharp bend is introduced right after the conserved motif C24P25: The peptide bond between P25 and S26 flips, which redirects the polypeptide chain at an 80 angle, and short helix A (residues 24 to 29) is formed. The conformation of short strand a1 (residues 22 to 24), involved in the interchain -sheet a1y1 in the prefusion conformation, is unchanged, although it is not paired to strand y1 of the adjacent protomer in the postfusion conformation (Fig. 2B).The small -sheet q1y2 of the native form is then broken, although the individual strands q1 and y2 retain their conformation in the postfusion form, and residues 384 to 400 (including helices H1 and H2 and strand y1) refold into helix H. This helix then positions itself in the grooves of the central core in an antiparallel manner to form the six-helix bundle. This movement repositions the TM domains at the same end of the molecule as the fusion domains (Figs. 1B and 2B). Finally, residues 259 to 261 and 403 to 405, which are distant by 1/230 A in the prefusion conformation, form sheet qz that zips together helices F and H in the postfusion state (Fig. 2B). Strands q and z are already in an extended structure in the native conformation, primed to form sheet qz in the postfusion form.The buried interface between two subunits in the trimer is 1600 A2 per protomer, as calculated by the Protein Interfaces, Surfaces, and Assemblies server (32). This value is less than half of that of the buried interface in the low-pH form. This explains the increased stability of the oligomeric structure of G at low pH (8). The interactions between protomers are all located in domain II (fig. S5) but are different from those observed in the postfusion form (Fig. 3, A and B). Not only is prefusion helix F2 shorter than postfusion helix F, it is also tilted and its C-terminal end is kept away from the trimer axis (Fig. 3A). This results from repulsive forces between the carboxylates of the three E286 amino acids (Fig. 3C). In contrast to the postfusion form, the main contribution to trimer stability is not due to the central helix bundle but appears to come from interchain -sheet a1y1 [which must break during the fusogenic transition, before the formation of helix H (Fig. 2B)] and its environment, burying 1250 A2 per protomer (Fig. 3D). The conformational change occurs at the viral surface even in absence of the target membrane. This seems to be topologically impossible without transient dissociation of the trimer. This hypothesis is in agreement with the large differences in the trimeric interfaces between the native and the postfusion conformations of G.

As in the postfusion state, V275 and L279 contribute to hydrophobic stabilizing interactions at the center of the molecule, but L283 now makes a lateral interaction with I278. The three E286 amino acids in the center are 4 A apart in native crystals. In the YbCl3-derivative crystal used for refinement of the model (table S1), they chelate an ytterbium ion (not shown), bringing their side-chain oxygen atoms within 3.5 A. (D) Close-up view of the outer region of the prefusion trimeric interface seen from the side. Contact residues are colored as in (C), with main-chain atoms included only when they participate in the contacts. Besides the canonical hydrogen bonds of the sheet, the interface is stabilized through extended van der Waals contacts and a hydrogen bond between the imidazole ring and the carboxyl group of T265 of the neighboring protomer. Finally, carboxyl groups of L384 and I387 make two hydrogen bonds with the guanidium group of R277 of the other chain. These three hydrogen bonds are displayed as magenta dashed lines. A number of the few conserved residues (fig. S2) are involved in key networks of interactions that are different in the two forms (Fig. 4). This set of residues includes amino acids D137, Y139, H407, and P408 that cluster together in the postfusion conformation to stabilize -sheet qz of the trimerization domain (Fig. 4B). In the prefusion conformation, the qz sheet does not exist: D137 and Y139 remain associated with the segment corresponding to the q strand and contribute to a network of hydrogen bonds that also involves conserved W236 of the PH domain (Fig. 4A, top). This network is disorganized during the rotation of the fusion domain relative to the PH domain (Fig. 2A). Conserved histidines-H407 [involved in a salt bridge with D137 in the low-pH structure (Fig. 4B)], H162 [previously shown to be involved in the interactions between fusion domains in the low-pH conformation (17)], and H60-cluster together (H60 is absent in RV G, but H86, which corresponds to S84 in VSV G, replaces it) (Fig. 4A, bottom). Protonation of these residues at low pH is likely to destabilize the interaction between the C-terminal segment of Gth and the fusion domain in the prefusion conformation, priming the initial movement of the fusion domain toward the target membrane. Conversely, the acidic amino acids that were either buried at the trimer interface (D268) or brought close together (D274 with D395 and E276 with D393) in the postfusion acidic conformation (17) are solvent-exposed in the prefusion state (not shown). Thus, the histidines in the prefusion form and the acidic residues in the postfusion form appear to constitute two pH-sensitive molecular switches.

The major antigenic sites of rhabdoviruses are located in the lateral and PH domains (4-6) (Fig. 5). The accessibility of antigenic sites to antibodies has been studied in detail for RV G. Antibodies directed against RV G site II are unable to recognize the protein in its low-pH conformation (7, 15). Indeed, during the structural transition, this site moves from the top of the molecule to a less accessible location at the surface of the virus. Conversely, the N-terminal epitope of RV G (NS) is only accessible in the low-pH conformation at the viral surface (31). Finally, RV G minor site a is recognized in both conformations (7). As for monoclonal antibody 17D2 (33) that binds only the prefusion conformation (34), its epitope is located in the segment of helix F that is unfolded in the native structure.

VSV sites A1 (residues 37 to 38, corresponding to RV antigenic site II located on segments composed of residues 34 to 42 and 198 to 200) and A2 (located at the surface of helix E indicated in Fig. 1) are indicated in shades of red. The RV G site recognized by antibody 17D2 (between residues 255 and 270) is in orange. NS (extending from amino acid 10 to 15) is in dark blue. VSV site B (extending from amino acid 341 to 347), corresponding to RV G minor antigenic site a (amino acid 340 to 342), is in magenta. In the prefusion conformation, the cleft between DI and DIII is colored black. It is flanked by residues 331 and 334, in gray, whose counterparts in RV affect virulence. The cellular receptor of VSV G has not been identified. Nevertheless, a canyon located between the lateral and PH domains is exposed at the top of the molecule and could be involved in ligand binding (Fig. 5A). In support of this, residues 330 and 333 of RV G, which are involved in the recognition of the putative viral receptor p75 (low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) (35) and which affect viral pathogenesis, align with residues 331 and 334 of VSV G, which are located at either end of the canyon.In a previous study, we estimated the minimal number of trimeric spikes involved in the formation of a RV fusion complex as about 15 (15). At the viral surface, a local organization of the spikes resembling the P6 lattice found in the crystal (in which all the spikes are oriented identically, with the major antigenic sites exposed at their tops) (fig. S3) might organize the glycoproteins in an optimal manner for a concerted conformational change. It might also facilitate the formation of the initial intermediates on the fusion pathway. Indeed, the initial lipidic deformations leading to the formation of the stalk and the initial fusion pore (36) can form inside the inner rim of such a hexagon. Reinforcing the idea that the P6 organization may reflect the structure of a fusion relevant complex, a local hexagonal lattice of spikes of similar dimensions has been observed at low temperature under mildly acidic conditions at the surface of some RV G mutants that were affected in the kinetics of their low pH-induced structural transition (31).It is often considered that fusogenic proteins drive membrane fusion by coupling irreversible protein refolding to membrane deformation (37). At least for rhabdoviral G, this is not the case. Rather, it appears that a concerted cooperative change of a large number of glycoproteins (perhaps organized in a hexagonal lattice, like the one present in the crystals) is used to overcome the high energetic barrier encountered during fusion.
AbstractWe present a statistical representation of the aggregate effects of deep convection on the chemistry and dynamics of the upper troposphere (UT) based on direct aircraft observations of the chemical composition of the UT over the eastern United States and Canada during summer. These measurements provide unique observational constraints on the chemistry occurring downwind of convection and the rate at which air in the UT is recycled. These results provide quantitative measures that can be used to evaluate global climate and chemistry models.Deep convection is a highly efficient mechanism for the vertical transport of air from near Earth's surface (0 to 2 km) to the UT (6 to 12 km) (1-5). Typical convective storms have spatial scales of tens of kilometers and vertical velocities as large as 15 m s-1 (6), making their local influence in the UT extremely strong. The rapid upward flow is balanced by downdrafts within the convective storms and much slower descending flow that occurs over a larger spatial scale (7). Convection is also associated with lightning, an important source of NOx (NOx NO + NO2) in the UT (8, 9). The source strength and spatial distribution of lightning NOx emissions are not well known, with estimates ranging from 2 to 20 Tg N year-1 for the global average (10), compared to 25 Tg N year-1 from fossil fuel combustion (11). Although there have been a number of case studies of the chemical effects of individual storms (12), studies of the aggregate effects of convection on the chemical composition and radiative forcing of the UT have been largely the province of modeling and theory (13, 14). Here, we describe measurements that provide a direct link between an observable property and the ensemble of convective events.The chemical and radiative consequences of convection and lightning are known to be large (2, 15, 16). Upper tropospheric O3, either transported directly from the boundary layer via convection or formed in situ after detrainment of convectively lofted O3 precursors [NOx, odd hydrogen radicals (HOx), and hydrocarbons] in the outflow region, directly affects climate through a positive radiative forcing (15). Additionally, deep convection accounts for a substantial fraction of the net flux of moisture from near Earth's surface to the UT (17) (Fig. 1). Thus, the rate at which the UT is turned over by convection has important implications for the hydrological cycle and the magnitude of the water vapor feedback on global temperature (18).

In this process, nitric acid (highly soluble) is efficiently scavenged while NOx (insoluble) remains. NOx is elevated by concurrent lightning NO production, resulting in high NOx/HNO3 ratios in the convective outflow region. After detrainment into the UT, NOx is converted to HNO3 by OH during the day and through reaction with NO3, followed by hydrolysis of the N2O5 product, at night. The chemical evolution of the NOx/HNO3 ratio provides a unique indicator of the length of time that a sampled air mass has been in the UT after convection. We describe a method for calculating, from in situ measurements of the chemical composition of the UT, the length of time that an air mass spends in the UT after convection, and we discuss the chemistry occurring in the outflow region as a function of time since convection. We use measurements of NO2 (19, 20) (NOx is calculated from NO2, O3, HO2, and photolysis rates), HNO3 (21, 22), OH and HO2 (23), O3, aerosol number density (24), SO2, actinic flux [from which photolysis rate coefficients (Jx) for NO2 (JNO2), HNO3 (JHNO3), and many other species are calculated] (25), CO (26), and CO2 (27) obtained during the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment-North America (INTEX-NA) aboard the NASA DC-8 (28). Measurements were made at altitudes between the surface and 12.5 km over a wide area of the United States and Canada, west of 40W and between 30 and 50N. There were a large number of vertical profiles, allowing a reasonably unbiased statistical sampling of air over this region during July and August 2004.We use the deviation of the observed NOx/HNO3 ratio from steady state as an indicator of convective influence. The NOx/HNO3 ratio is reset to near infinity in moist convection as a result of preferential wet scavenging of HNO3 relative to NOx (i.e., the solubility of HNO3 is 1/2108 times that of NOx) (29). Further, lightning-produced NOx, often coincident with convection, markedly enhances NOx in the outflow region. The coupling of these processes makes the NOx/HNO3 ratio in the UT an effective indicator of convective influence, where NOx/HNO3 >> 1 is indicative of recent cloud outflow (30, 31). In the days after convection, the ratio decays toward steady state, providing a chemical clock that marks the length of time that an air mass has spent in the UT after convection (32). Previous studies have used species that have no UT source (e.g., CH3I) (33) or alternative chemical ratios to provide estimates of age of air in the UT (34, 35). Our study is unique because of the availability of NO2, OH, and HNO3 measurements with high time resolution, which allows us to build a much more extensive data set than in previous studies. After the initial turbulent mixing in the near field of the convection, mixing is slow; thus, the time evolution of the NOx/HNO3 ratio after convection depends largely on the partitioning of NOx (between NO and NO2), the concentration of OH, and the actinic flux.Reactive nitrogen partitioning in the UT. The chemical sinks of UT NOx are reaction with OH to produce HNO3 (Eq. 1) and loss through NO3 (Eqs. 2a and 2b), where M represents a third molecule (e.g., N2, O2) that absorbs the excess vibrational energy of the association reaction, followed by hydrolysis of N2O5 to produce HNO3 (36). NOx is regenerated by HNO3 photolysis and reaction of OH with HNO3 (and subsequent NO3 photolysis to NO2) (Eqs. 3 and 4). (1)(2a)(2b)(3)(4) Assuming a diurnal steady state for HNO3, the NOx/HNO3 ratio can be calculated as (5) where k is the reaction rate coefficient. NOx/HNO3 is expected to be larger than the steady-state value because wet scavenging removes HNO3 faster than the time to reach steady state (37). Our observations show the NOx/HNO3 ratio to be much higher than the ratio described by Eq. 5 at altitudes greater than 6 km (Fig. 2). The difference between the observed ratio and that predicted by Eq. 5 grows with altitude, reaching a maximum at 10 km. Previous observations of NOx and HNO3 [either measured directly or calculated from observations of NOx, peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN), and NOy NOx + total peroxy nitrates + total alkyl nitrates + HNO3 +2 * N2O5 + other minor components)] have shown NOx/HNO3 to be significantly larger than the steady-state prediction in the UT (30, 31, 38-42). This has been shown to be primarily a result of convection and lightning reinitializing the system before steady state is achieved (30, 31). Although there are other hypotheses (40-42), we [like Jaegle et al. (31)] find no evidence for a mechanism other than convection responsible for holding NOx/HNO3 out of steady state in the UT.

Chemical signatures of convection.Figure 3 depicts one of many convectively influenced air masses sampled in the UT during INTEX-NA. Three distinct convective events (40 to 80 km wide) are identified by enhancements in NOx/HNO3 in Fig. 3A. Coincident enhancements are present in SO2, an indicator of a recent boundary-layer source for this air, and in ultrafine condensation nuclei (UCN) (3 Dp 10 nm, where Dp is the particle diameter), an indicator of cloud detrainment (Fig. 3B) (43, 44). Sharp decreases in CO2 also indicate the presence of boundary-layer air that has been depleted in CO2 by photosynthetic activity (Fig. 3C) (44). Enhancements in CO, CH2O, and various hydrocarbons relative to the surrounding UT air were also observed in these plumes, confirming that these parcels originate from the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Backward air trajectories, initialized along the flight track and mapped onto the spatial and temporal distribution of cloud-to-ground lightning strikes, indicate that this air mass was influenced by lightning about 1 day before DC-8 sampling (Fig. 3E). Such features with high NOx/HNO3 ratios were observed throughout the UT during INTEX-NA. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

To assess the extent to which the UT over the eastern United States and Canada during the summer of 2004 was influenced by convection, and to describe the chemical evolution of convective outflow, we used a constrained time-dependent photochemical box model to map the observed NOx/HNO3 ratio to the time since the ratio was last reinitialized (45). It was initialized with observations at 1-km vertical intervals from 6 to 12 km. The derived timing indicator for the convectively influenced air sampled on 11 August 2006 is shown in Fig. 3D.

The fraction of air that had been influenced by convection within the past 2 days (f 0.02 day-1 after detrainment into the UT. This is in good agreement with the upper limit of 0.06 to 0.1 day-1 determined by Ray et al. from observations of convective plumes observed in the stratosphere (47). However, it is slower than the 2-day dilution time scale determined by Wang et al. from observations in the UT (32). Because the DC-8 did not routinely sample in the turbulent environment directly surrounding convective outflow, this mixing rate likely reflects diffusive and shear-induced mixing subsequent to the initial turbulent mixing occurring during detrainment from the convective system.Figure 5B shows the O3 mixing ratio as a function of time since convection. We find that on average, convectively lofted air masses contain less O3 than the background UT. This result is consistent with the observed vertical gradient in O3 measured over the continental United States during INTEX-NA, with lower O3 in the PBL than above (48). Rapid changes in the O3 mixing ratio are observed during the first 2 days after detrainment, with the observed O3 10 nmol mol-1 above the initial value by the end of day 2. The observed rate of increase slows exponentially with an asymptote at long times approaching zero and the O3 mixing ratio approaching a constant value of 82 nmol mol-1. This is a surprising result, as our model of the O3 rate of change never approaches zero but continues to predict a net increase of 3 nmol mol-1 O3 day-1 at the end of day 5 (49).Constraints on the convective turnover rate of the UT. The convective turnover rate of the UT is critical for accurately describing NOx, HOx, and O3 chemistry in the UT (50). However, at present there are few observation-based constraints available (either meteorological or chemical) to test the aggregate effects of convection in the current generation of global chemistry and climate models. To determine the convective turnover rate of the UT from the observations presented here, it is necessary to know with high confidence both the extent to which the UT is influenced by convection and the fraction of PBL air in the convectively influenced air masses.To determine the fraction of PBL air contained in fresh convective outflow, we used observations of insoluble long-lived species. Assuming that we conducted a statistically unbiased sampling of both the boundary layer and free troposphere during INTEX-NA, we can calculate the fraction of PBL air present in fresh convection (f) according to (6) where [X]UT(t=0) is the mean mixing ratio of species X in fresh convective outflow (as identified using our timing indicator), [X]UT is the mean mixing ratio of species X in the UT (7.5 to 11.5 km), and [X]surface is the mean mixing ratio of species X between 0 and 1.5 km. Using observations of CO, CO2, CH3OH, CH4, and C2H6 we calculated the fraction of PBL air in fresh convection to be 0.19 0.05, 0.11 0.03, 0.26 0.05, 0.15 0.05, and 0.34 0.09, respectively. We calculated a weighted average for the fraction of PBL air in convective outflow of 0.17 0.02 by weighting each value by the inverse square of its uncertainty. This result implies that convectively lofted PBL air rapidly entrains the surrounding air either during ascent or in the turbulent environment of the detraining flow. These results are consistent with the observations of Ray et al., who determined the fraction of tropospheric air in convective plumes sampled in the stratosphere to be between 0.1 and 0.4 (47). However, our results suggest a smaller fraction than the observations of Cohan et al., who calculated the fraction of boundary-layer air in fresh convective outflow to be between 0.32 and 0.64 (33), and the modeling studies of Mullendore et al., who calculated the fraction of PBL air present in the convective outflow region of a supercell storm 10 hours after storm initialization to be 0.26 (51).Figure 6A shows the normalized frequency distribution of the time since convection, based on the NOx/HNO3 ratio. We found that 54% of the air between 7.5 and 11.5 km was influenced by convection during the past 2 days. The convective outflow was strongest between 9.5 and 10.5 km, where the fraction of air that is less than 2 days old exceeds 69%. The vertical distribution presented here is consistent with previous analyses of convective outflow to the UT from individual storms (4, 52) and the vertical distribution of convectively influenced laminae observed in O3 sonde data from the summer of 2004 over the northeastern United States. The shift toward longer times between 10.5 and 11.5 km suggests two possibilities: that convective cloud tops on average do not extend higher than 10.5 km over the mid-latitudes during summer (53), or that transport of stratospheric air rich in HNO3 contributes to keeping the NOx/HNO3 ratio low at altitudes higher than 10.5 km.To constrain the turnover rate of the UT from the ensemble statistics generated from our calculated time since convective influence (Fig. 6A), we constructed a two-dimensional (2D) model of the UT. On the basis of typical wind speeds, we assume that it takes 4 days for any individual model point to pass through the sampling region and that each point has not been influenced by convection upon entering the sampling window. Every 6 hours, we represented convection by randomly reinitializing the age of x% of the points to 0 [the value of x is determined by the turnover rate (varied between 0.05 and 0.2 day-1) and the fraction of PBL air contained in fresh convection (assumed to be a constant at 0.17)], and we then diluted each point with the mean value of the adjacent 8 points at the rate of 0.05 day-1.Figure 6B depicts the observed and three calculated normalized frequency distributions of time since convective influence between 7.5 and 11.5 km. The shape of the distribution suggests that UT air sampled during INTEX-NA was strongly influenced by convection, and that convectively lofted plumes did not have sufficient time to either mix or age before sampling; instead, air was transported to the east out of the domain. Calculated frequency distributions of time since convection, obtained by collecting the points in the eastern half of the 2D UT model analysis (where we sampled most frequently), are also shown in Fig. 6B. Assuming the DC-8 made a statistically unbiased sampling of the continental UT during summer, the best match among the three model calculations and observations would imply a convective turnover rate between 0.1 and 0.2 day-1. However, if we assume that the DC-8 had a positive bias toward sampling fresh convection, our observed frequency distributions are most consistent with a convective turnover rate closer to 0.1 day-1 (54).For comparison, the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-4) data assimilation model detrainment cloud mass flux between 400 and 200 hPa (1/27.2 to 11.8 km) for the domain (80 to 100W for 30 to 35N and 70 to 100W for 35 to 50N) between 1 July and 15 August 2004 was 0.0085 kg m-2 s-1. This corresponds to a turnover rate of 0.37 day-1 (using a column mass of 1.9 * 103 kg m-2 between 7.2 and 11.8 km). Further investigation is needed to understand the source of the difference between our observed turnover rate and the one derived from the model.Conclusions. Our observations provide unique constraints on (i) the extent to which convection perturbs the continental UT during summer, (ii) the fraction of boundary-layer air present in convective outflow, and (iii) the convective overturning rate of the UT. In addition, the chemical clock described here defines a coordinate that can be used to assess the chemistry occurring downwind of convective injection. These direct measures of atmospheric rates present a new opportunity for quantitative tests of model representations of processes governing UT ozone, convection, and lightning and their impact on climate.

Abstract Wave-particle duality is strikingly illustrated by Wheeler's delayed-choice gedanken experiment, where the configuration of a two-path interferometer is chosen after a single-photon pulse has entered it: Either the interferometer is closed (that is, the two paths are recombined) and the interference is observed, or the interferometer remains open and the path followed by the photon is measured. We report an almost ideal realization of that gedanken experiment with single photons allowing unambiguous which-way measurements. The choice between open and closed configurations, made by a quantum random number generator, is relativistically separated from the entry of the photon into the interferometer. Young's double-slit experiment, realized with particles sent one at a time through an interferometer, is at the heart of quantum mechanics (1). The striking feature is that the phenomenon of interference, interpreted as a wave following two paths simultaneously, is incompatible with our common-sense representation of a particle following one route or the other but not both. Several single-photon interference experiments (2-6) have confirmed the wave-particle duality of the light field. To understand their meaning, consider the single-photon interference experiment sketched in Fig. 1. In the closed interferometer configuration, a single-photon pulse is split by a first beamsplitter BSinput of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and travels through it until a second beamsplitter BSoutput recombines the two interfering arms. When the phase shift between the two arms is varied, interference appears as a modulation of the detection probabilities at output ports 1 and 2, respectively, as cos2 and sin2 . This result is the one expected for a wave, and as Wheeler pointed out, "[this] is evidence... that each arriving light quantum has arrived by both routes" (7). If BSoutput is removed (the open configuration), each detector D1 or D2 on the output ports is then associated with a given path of the interferometer, and, provided one uses true single-photon light pulses, "[either] one counter goes off, or the other. Thus the photon has traveled only one route" (7). Such an experiment supports Bohr's statement that the behavior of a quantum system is determined by the type of measurement performed on it (8). Moreover, it is clear that for the two complementary measurements considered here, the corresponding experimental settings are mutually exclusive; that is, BSoutput cannot be simultaneously present and absent. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Wheeler's delayed-choice gedanken experiment proposal. The choice to introduce or remove beamsplitter BSoutput (closed or open configuration) is made only after the passage of the photon at BSinput, so that the photon entering the interferometer "cannot know" which of the two complementary experiments (path difference versus which-way) will be performed at the output. In experiments where the choice between the two settings is made long in advance, one could reconcile Bohr's complementarity with Einstein's local conception of the physical reality. Indeed, when the photon enters the interferometer, it could have received some "hidden information" on the chosen experimental configuration and could then adjust its behavior accordingly (9). To rule out that too-naive interpretation of quantum mechanical complementarity, Wheeler proposed the "delayed-choice" gedanken experiment in which the choice of which property will be observed is made after the photon has passed BSinput: "Thus one decides the photon shall have come by one route or by both routes after it has already done its travel" (7). Since Wheeler's proposal, several delayed-choice experiments have been reported (10-15). However, none of them fully followed the original scheme, which required the use of the single-particle quantum state as well as relativistic space-like separation between the choice of interferometer configuration and the entry of the particle into the interferometer. We report the realization of such a delayed-choice experiment in a scheme close to the ideal original proposal (Fig. 1). The choice to insert or remove BSoutput is randomly decided through the use of a quantum random number generator (QRNG). The QRNG is located close to BSoutput and is far enough from the input so that no information about the choice can reach the photon before it passes through BSinput. Our single-photon source, previously developed for quantum key distribution (16, 17), is based on the pulsed, optically excited photoluminescence of a single nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) color center in a diamond nanocrystal (18). At the single-emitter level, these photoluminescent centers, which can be individually addressed with the use of confocal microscopy (19), have shown unsurpassed efficiency and photostability at room temperature (20, 21). In addition, it is possible to obtain single photons with a well-defined polarization (16, 22). The delayed-choice scheme is implemented as follows. Linearly polarized single photons are sent by a polarization beamsplitter BSinput through an interferometer (length 48 m) with two spatially separated paths associated with orthogonal S and P polarizations (Fig. 2). The movable output beamsplitter BSoutput consists of the combination of a half-wave plate, a polarization beamsplitter BS', an electro-optical modulator (EOM) with its optical axis oriented at 22.5 from input polarizations, and a Wollaston prism. The two beams of the interferometer, which are spatially separated and orthogonally polarized, are first overlapped by BS' but can still be unambiguously identified by their polarization. Then, the choice between the two interferometer configurations, closed or open, is realized with the EOM, which can be switched between two different configurations within 40 ns by means of a homebuilt fast driver (16): Either no voltage is applied to the EOM, or its half-wave voltage V is applied to it. In the first case, the situation corresponds to the removal of BSoutput and the two paths remain uncombined (open configuration). Because the original S and P polarizations of the two paths are oriented along prism polarization eigenstates, each "click" of one detector D1 or D2 placed on the output ports is associated with a specific path (path 1 or path 2, respectively). When the V voltage is applied, the EOM is equivalent to a half-wave plate that rotates the input polarizations by an angle of 45. The prism then recombines the two rotated polarizations that have traveled along different optical paths, and interference appears on the two output ports. We then have the closed interferometer configuration (22). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2. Experimental realization of Wheeler's gedanken experiment. Single photons emitted by a single N-V color center are sent through a 48-m polarization interferometer, equivalent to a time of flight of about 160 ns. A binary random number 0 or 1, generated by the QRNG, drives the EOM voltage between V = 0 and V = V within 40 ns, after an electronic delay of 80 ns. Two synchronized signals from the clock are used to trigger the single-photon emission and the QNRG. In the laboratory frame of reference, the random choice between the open and the closed configuration is made simultaneously with the entry of the photon into the interferometer. Taking advantage of the fact that the QNRG is located at the output of the interferometer, such timing ensures that the photon enters the future light cone of the random choice when it is at about the middle of the interferometer, long after passing BSinput. To ensure the relativistic space-like separation between the choice of the interferometer configuration and the passage of the photon at BSinput, we configured the EOM switching process to be randomly decided in real time by the QRNG located close to the output of the interferometer (48 m from BSinput). The random number is generated by sampling the amplified shot noise of a white-light beam. Shot noise is an intrinsic quantum random process, and its value at a given time cannot be predicted (23). The timing of the experiment ensures the required relativistic space-like separation (22). Then, no information about the interferometer configuration choice can reach the photon before it enters the interferometer. The single-photon behavior was first tested using the two output detectors feeding single and coincidence counters with BSoutput removed (open configuration). We used an approach similar to the one described in (2) and (6). Consider a run corresponding to NT trigger pulses applied to the emitter, with N1 counts detected in path 1 of the interferometer by D1, N2 counts detected in path 2 by D2, and NC detected coincidences corresponding to joint photodetections on D1 and D2 (Fig. 2). Any description in which light is treated as a classical wave, such as the semiclassical theory with quantized photo-detectors (24), predicts that these numbers of counts should obey the inequality (1) Violation of this inequality thus gives a quantitative criterion that characterizes nonclassical behavior. For a single-photon wavepacket, quantum optics predicts perfect anticorrelation (i.e., = 0) in agreement with the intuitive image that a single particle cannot be detected simultaneously in the two paths of the interferometer (2). We measured = 0.12 0.01, hence we are indeed close to the pure single-photon regime. The nonideal value of the parameter is due to residual background photoluminescence of the diamond sample and to the two-phonon Raman scattering line, which both produce uncorrelated photons with Poissonian statistics (6). With single-photon pulses in the open configuration, we expected each detector D1 and D2 to be unambiguously associated with a given path of the interferometer. To test this point, we evaluated the "which-way" information parameter I =(N1 - N2)/(N1 + N2) (25-28) by blocking one path (e.g., path 2) and measuring the counting rates at D1 and D2. A value of I higher than 0.99 was measured, limited by detector dark counts and residual imperfections of the optical components. The same value was obtained when the other path was blocked (e.g., path 1). In the open configuration, we thus have an almost ideal which-way measurement. The delayed-choice experiment itself is performed with the EOM randomly switched for each photon sent into the interferometer, corresponding to a random choice between the open and closed configurations. The phase shift between the two interferometer arms is varied by tilting the second polarization beamsplitter BS' with a piezoelectric actuator (PZT). For each photon, we recorded the chosen configuration, the detection events, and the PZT position. All raw data were saved in real time and were processed only after a run was completed. For each PZT position, detection events on D1 and D2 corresponding to each configuration were sorted (Fig. 3). In the closed configuration, we observed interference with 0.94 visibility. We attribute the departure from unity to an imperfect overlap of the two interfering beams. In the open configuration, interference totally disappears, as evidenced by the absence of modulation in the two output ports when the phase shift was varied. We checked that in the delayed-choice configuration, parameters and I kept the same values as measured in the preliminary tests presented above.

Each point, recorded with acquisition time of 1.9 s, corresponds to the detection of about 2600 photons. The detector dark counts, 59 s-1 for D1 (blue points) and 70 s-1 for D2 (red points), have been subtracted from the data. (A) Cases when V is applied on the EOM (closed configuration); interference with 94% visibility is obtained. (B) Cases when no voltage is applied on the EOM (open configuration); no interference is observed and equal detection probabilities (0.50 0.01) on the two output ports are measured, corresponding to full knowledge of the complementary which-way information (I parameter greater than 99%). Our realization of Wheeler's delayed-choice gedanken experiment demonstrates that the behavior of the photon in the interferometer depends on the choice of the observable that is measured, even when that choice is made at a position and a time such that it is separated from the entrance of the photon into the interferometer by a space-like interval. In Wheeler'swords, as no signal traveling at a velocity less than that of light can connect these two events, "we have a strange inversion of the normal order of time. We, now, by moving the mirror in or out have an unavoidable effect on what we have a right to say about the already past history of that photon" (7). Once more, we find that nature behaves in agreement with the predictions of quantum mechanics even in surprising situations where a tension with relativity seems to appear (29).
Abstract We report thermodynamic measurements in a magnetic-field-driven quantum critical point of a heavy fermion metal, YbRh2Si2. The data provide evidence for an energy scale in the equilibrium excitation spectrum that is in addition to the one expected from the slow fluctuations of the order parameter. Both energy scales approach zero as the quantum critical point is reached, thereby providing evidence for a new class of quantum criticality. Quantum criticality encodes the strong fluctuations of matter undergoing a second-order phase transition at zero temperature. It underlies the unusual properties observed in a host of quantum materials. A basic question that remains unsettled concerns its proper theoretical description, which is challenging because the fluctuations are both collective and quantum mechanical. One class of theory, based on the traditional formulation of classical critical phenomena (1), considers the fluctuations of a classical variable-Laudau's order parameter-in both spatial and temporal dimensions (2-5). The slowing down of the order-parameter fluctuations accompanies the divergence of a spatial correlation length; at each value of the tuning parameter, the equilibrium many-body spectrum contains a single-excitation energy scale, which vanishes at the quantum critical point (QCP) (6). An unconventional class of theory (7-9), by contrast, is inherently quantum mechanical; it explicitly invokes quantum entanglement effects, which are manifested through vanishing energy scales that are in addition to the one associated with the slowing down of order-parameter fluctuations. The nature of quantum criticality can therefore be experimentally elucidated by determining whether single or multiple energy scales vanish as the QCP is reached. We consider the heavy-fermion metal YbRh2Si2 (YRS) and show that multiple energy scales vanish as its QCP is approached and, in addition, suggest that critical electronic modes coexist with the slow fluctuations of the magnetic order parameter. A direct way to probe the intrinsic energy scales in the equilibrium spectrum near a QCP is to measure thermodynamic properties. Another approach is to measure the fluctuation spectrum in equilibrium, for example by inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Such equilibrium methods are in contrast to transport experiments, which are influenced by electronic relaxational properties, especially for anisotropic and multiband systems. As extraction of critical energy scales requires measurements through fine steps of the control parameter, which is nearly impossible for inelastic neutron scattering, we report here measurements of thermodynamic properties of YRS across its magnetic QCP. We chose to work with the tetragonal heavy fermion compound YRS because it presents a clean and stoichiometric material that is well characterized (10). In the absence of an external magnetic field, YRS shows very weak antiferromagnetic (AF) order at TN =70mK, with an ordered moment of only 1/210-31/2B/Yb (11). A small magnetic field (H c 0.06 T for the field applied within the easy ab plane, and H||c = 0.66 T along the hard c axis) suppresses the transition temperature and accesses the QCP (12). The ability to use such a small magnetic field to access the QCP makes YRS suited for our purpose; the determination of energy scales requires scanning across the phase transition, and an external magnetic field can be tuned with relative ease and continuously. Hall effect measurements (13) on YRS have shown a large and rapid crossover in the Hall constant at a temperature-dependent magnetic field away from the antiferromagnetic transition. In the zero-temperature limit, this crossover extrapolates to a jump across the QCP, which has been interpreted as a large change of the Fermi surface volume. This represents yet another advantage of measuring the thermodynamic properties in YRS, because they can be compared with their transport counterparts. We measured the isothermal linear magnetostriction lnL /H, where L is the length along the [110] direction within the tetragonal ab plane, and the magnetic field H is applied along the same direction (H c). Figure 1 shows the magnetostriction as a function of the magnetic field, at temperatures ranging from 0.02 K to 0.8 K. For temperatures below 0.075 K, a clear discontinuity is observed when suppressing the AF order by a critical magnetic field. At T > 0.075 K, it is seen that, for a small magnetic field, the isothermal magnetostriction linearly depends on the magnetic field, as is the case in typical metals (14). Beyond a crossover field, however, there is a change to a high-field region with a different slope. The crossover field decreases as the temperature is reduced.

The symbols represent the linear coefficient [110] = lnL /H (where L is the sample length along the [110] direction within the tetragonal ab plane) versus H at various temperatures. Note that [110] (as is more clearly seen in the measured length versus H, which shows a change in slope but does not contain any discontinuity), demonstrating the continuous nature of the magnetic transition at the critical field of 0.05 T. Similar behavior is observed at various different temperatures below 0.075 K, for example, at 0.03 K and 0.05 K. The solid lines for T 0.13 K are fits using the integral of the crossover function f(H, T), which reveal a characteristic field scale H0(T) along which the magnetostriction shows a drastic change in slope. To understand this crossover, we compare it with the field-dependent isothermal behavior of other thermodynamic and transport quantities. Figure 2A illustrates the similarity of the crossover in the magnetostriction to that seen in the field-dependent isothermal Hall resistivity H (measured with H||c). The Hall coefficient was described (13) by an empirical crossover function of the form f(H, T)= A2 - (A2 - A1)/[1 + (H/H0)p]; the crossover field scale H0(T) is equivalent to an energy scale T*(H). We have analyzed the magnetostriction data, as well as the existing magnetization data (H c) (15, 16), with the same crossover function. No corresponding anomalies can be resolved in the magnetization data for H||c (16), which is almost linear in H. The solid curves in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2A correspond to fits of [110], M M + H and the Hall resistivity H. Figure 2B shows the three sets of H0(T) obtained from such fits. Their overlap represents a key conclusion of the present work; it suggests that they define one energy scale T*(H). This scale is seen to be distinct from either the transition temperature (TN) for the magnetic ordering at H Hc. For all three quantities, the width of the crossover extrapolates to zero at T =0, implying that the differentials of the magnetostriction, magnetization, and Hall resistivity have a jump in the zero-temperature limit (supporting online text).

(A) The field dependence (H c) of the magnetostriction [110], M M + H (where = M/H), and the Hall resistivity H for H||c (for the latter, the field values have been divided by the anisotropy factor 13.2, which corresponds to the ratio of the critical fields in the Hall and magnetostriction measurements), respectively, all at T =0.5K; similar behavior is observed at other temperatures. For [110](H c), the sample has a residual resistivity 0 = 0.5 1/2 copyright cm and Hc =0.05T; for M (H c), the sample has 0 =1.0 1/2 copyright cm and Hc =0.06T; and for H(H|| c), the sample has 0 =1.0 1/2 copyright cm and Hc =0.66T. The solid lines correspond to fits using the integral of the same crossover function f(H, T). Each data set has been normalized by its initial slope. For clarity, the three data sets have been shifted by different amounts vertically: This is represented by the three separate zero marks along the vertical axis for the three quantities. H - H, a, where H, a is the anomalous Hall resistivity (13), behaves similarly to H. Weanalyzed M (H), which is the field derivative of the magnetic free energy contribution (-M * H); fitting M(H) leads to similar conclusions, although the quality of the fit is somewhat poorer because M versus H is not as linear as M at high fields (fig. S2). (B) The crossover field scale H0 as determined from magnetostriction, M , and Hall resistivity using the same symbols as in A. It is equivalent to the energy scale T*(H). The gray diamonds and triangles represent, respectively, the Neel ordering temperature (TN) and the crossover temperature (TLFL), below which the electrical resistivity has the Fermi liquid form = 0 + AT2, as determined from measurements on a single crystal with 0 =0.5 1/2 copyright cm and Hc = 0.05 T. The solid and dotted lines are guides to the eye; for the latter, data points outside the plotted field regime have also been used. The horizontal error bars represent the fitting error rather than the width of the crossover. The results raise the important question of the causal relation between the thermodynamic and electronic transport properties. One might argue (17) that the Hall-effect evolution as a function of the magnetic field (13) is causedby the Zeeman splitting of the Fermi surface induced by the magnetization (and reflected in the magnetostriction). However, the magnetization only displays a smeared kink, and the corresponding Fermi surface change would at most produce a smeared kink in the evolution of the Hall coefficient; such a kink is too weak compared with the smeared jump seen experimentally. Moreover, along the c axis, even such a smeared kink feature is absent in the magnetization versus the magnetic field. Instead, it is more natural to view the nonanalyticities in both the magnetostriction and magnetization as thermodynamic manifestations of the large Fermi surface jump caused by an f-electron localization. To explore this issue further, we have also studied the longitudinal magnetoresistivity. Figure 3 shows the electrical resistivity as a function of the magnetic field (H c), at various temperatures. The broadened steplike decrease, observed at all temperatures, corresponds to the crossover observed in the other properties. Indeed, as shown in inset A, the crossover fields determined from the minima of the derivative d/dH (inset B) fall on the same T*(H) line determined from the magnetostriction, magnetization, and Hall effect. In addition, inset B shows that the width of the crossover decreases as the temperature is lowered. A detailed analysis shows that the crossover width goes to zero in the zero-temperature limit (supporting online text), implying a jump in the residual resistivity across the magnetic QCP. This is in accordance with the theoretical expectations (18, 19) associated with an f-electron localization transition. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3.

The arrows mark the positions of inflection points in (H). The inset A displays the phase diagram, where the gray shaded area represents the range of H0(T) values shown in Fig. 2B. Open yellow triangles mark the positions of the inflection points in the longitudinal electrical resistivity. The smeared kink behavior in the isothermal M versus H corresponds to a peak in the T dependence of . The latter has been observed (20); the corresponding peak temperature versus H for a sample with 0 =0.5 1/2 copyright cm and Hc = 0.05 T is displayed by the dark blue diamonds and found to be consistent with H0(T). Inset B displays the derivative d/dH versus H at both T =0.1 K and T = 0.3 K. Arrows mark the minima, corresponding to the inflection points in (H). Figure 3, inset A, also shows the temperature scale as a function of field, extracted from the peak in the T-dependence of the differential susceptibility ac = M/H; the latter, observed earlier (20), necessarily accompanies the smeared kink behavior in the isothermal M versus H. It is clearly seen that this scale too falls on the same T*(H) line. Our results shed light on the overall phase diagram of this clean stoichiometric quantum critical material. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements (21), while signaling the dominance of AF fluctuations in the quantum critical regime, have also revealed enhanced ferromagnetic fluctuations. The Korringa ratio, S =1/T1TK2, is small-on the order of 0.1S0, where S0 is the corresponding ratio for non-interacting electrons. Further evidence for enhanced ferromagnetic fluctuations has come from magnetization measurements (20). The Wilson ratio-RW = k 2B/(1/201/22eff) * /, with 1/2eff =1.4 1/2B/Yb (22)-is strongly enhanced for an extended region of the phase diagram. It is already large (1/220) for magnetic fields of a few teslas and further increases as the field is reduced toward Hc. Therefore, it could be tempting to consider the q 1/20 magnetic fluctuation as the dominant critical fluctuation (17), especially because a conventional ferromagnetic QCP would yield a Gruneisen exponent (23) of 1/z1/4 = 2/3, close to what is observed in YRS (24). This picture is problematic for a number of reasons, however. First, neither three-dimensional (3D) nor 2D ferromagnetic spin fluctuations can generate the fractional exponent observed in the temperature dependence of the uniform spin susceptibility (20). Second, ferromagnetic spin fluctuations would lead to a divergent 1/T1 (1/21/T x, with x = 1/3 and 1/2 for 3D and 2D cases, respectively) that is in contrast to the observation that 1/T1 is approximately constant when the NMR measurement field is extrapolated to the quantum critical regime (11). Third, because ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are inefficient in affecting charge transport, this picture contradicts the observation of a nearly H-independent ratio A/2 that accompanies a strongly H-dependent A and (20). Here, A is the coefficient of the T2 component of the resistivity. The data presented here show that the uniform magnetization (q = 0) depends on the same underlying physics as that for the charge transport. Because the transport is dominated by large q fluctuations, the results imply that the q = 0 magnetic fluctuations are a part of overall fluctuations in an extended range of wave-vector scales. It is then more natural to assume that the dynamical spin susceptibility at different wave vectors obeys the same form (8, 25) as that observed in another prototypical quantum critical heavy fermion metal, CeCu5.9Au0.1 (17): (q, T, copyright )1/2[q + TW(/T)]-1. At the QCP, the Weiss field at the antiferromagnetic wave vector (q = Q) vanishes: Q =0. At the same time, and unlike for CeCu5.9Au0.1, q=0 is very small in YRS. Based on the saturation scale seen in the temperature dependence of the uniform magnetic susceptibility (20) and the NMR Knight shift data (21) near Hc, we estimate q = 0 to be on the order of 0.3 K (26). When q moves away from either 0 or Q, q increases to the order of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction or bare Kondo scale [about 25 K for YRS (10)], as illustrated in Fig. 4. The enhanced uniform magnetic susceptibility, the concomitant enhanced Wilson ratio (20), and the small S 1/T1TK2 naturally follow from this picture. Moreover, both q=0 and q=Q scale similarly with H, and the observation that A/2 is nearly H-independent is in fact a manifestation of an H-independent A/2Q. All this leads to the conclusion that the origin of the T* line lies in an electronic slowing down and, for YRS, the strong q = 0 fluctuations happen to be a consequence of the latter as well. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 4. Sketch of the suggested q dependence of the Weiss temperature q, which enters the magnetic susceptibility. As H reaches Hc, it vanishes at the antiferromagnetic wave vector Q, as shown. In addition, q has a second minimum at q = 0. Ferromagnetic fluctuations at q =0 remain important as q = Q goes to zero. We now turn to more detailed theoretical implications of our results. Our measurements establish that the energy scale T* is associated with the equilibrium many-body spectrum (which alone determines thermodynamics). Moreover, this scale is distinct from the Landau Fermi liquid scale, TLFL, because physical quantities manifest rather different behavior across the two scales (supporting online text). Finally, both of these scales vanish at the QCP. These findings contradict the conventional order-parameter fluctuation theory in at least two respects. First, the only low-energy scale in that theory is associated with the magnetic slowing down which, for H > Hc, is TLFL (2-5). Second, within that theory, a sharp feature in thermodynamics and transport quantities might arise near TN only. Our results are instead consistent with magnetic quantum criticality accompanied by the destruction of Kondo entanglement. In the form of local quantum criticality (7, 8), a collapse of a large Fermi surface as H decreases leads to an added energy scale characterizing an electronic slowing down and, in addition, yields a zero-temperature jump in the Hall coefficient and in the field differentials of the thermodynamic quantities. An additional vanishing energy scale also exists in the "deconfined" quantum criticality scenario for insulating quantum magnets (9), as well as in its extension to itinerant electron systems (27, 28) that are argued to be relevant to quantum critical heavy fermion metals.
Abstract Clustering data by identifying a subset of representative examples is important for processing sensory signals and detecting patterns in data. Such "exemplars" can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called "affinity propagation," which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time. Clustering data based on a measure of similarity is a critical step in scientific data analysis and in engineering systems. A common approach is to use data to learn a set of centers such that the sum of squared errors between data points and their nearest centers is small. When the centers are selected from actual data points, they are called "exemplars." The popular k-centers clustering technique (1) begins with an initial set of randomly selected exemplars and iteratively refines this set so as to decrease the sum of squared errors. k-centers clustering is quite sensitive to the initial selection of exemplars, so it is usually rerun many times with different initializations in an attempt to find a good solution. However, this works well only when the number of clusters is small and chances are good that at least one random initialization is close to a good solution. We take a quite different approach and introduce a method that simultaneously considers all data points as potential exemplars. By viewing each data point as a node in a network, we devised a method that recursively transmits real-valued messages along edges of the network until a good set of exemplars and corresponding clusters emerges. As described later, messages are updated on the basis of simple formulas that search for minima of an appropriately chosen energy function. At any point in time, the magnitude of each message reflects the current affinity that one data point has for choosing another data point as its exemplar, so we call our method "affinity propagation." Figure 1A illustrates how clusters gradually emerge during the message-passing procedure. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. How affinity propagation works. (A) Affinity propagation is illustrated for two-dimensional data points, where negative Euclidean distance (squared error) was used to measure similarity. Each point is colored according to the current evidence that it is a cluster center (exemplar). The darkness of the arrow directed from point i to point k corresponds to the strength of the transmitted message that point i belongs to exemplar point k.(B) "Responsibilities" r(i, k) are sent from data points to candidate exemplars and indicate how strongly each data point favors the candidate exemplar over other candidate exemplars. (C) "Availabilities" a(i, k) are sent from candidate exemplars to data points and indicate to what degree each candidate exemplar is available as a cluster center for the data point. (D) The effect of the value of the input preference (common for all data points) on the number of identified exemplars (number of clusters) is shown. The value that was used in (A) is also shown, which was computed from the median of the pairwise similarities. Affinity propagation takes as input a collection of real-valued similarities between data points, where the similarity s(i, k) indicates how well the data point with index k is suited to be the exemplar for data point i. When the goal is to minimize squared error, each similarity is set to a negative squared error (Euclidean distance): For points xi and xk, s(i, k)= -||xi - xk||2. Indeed, the method described here can be applied when the optimization criterion is much more general. Later, we describe tasks where similarities are derived for pairs of images, pairs of microarray measurements, pairs of English sentences, and pairs of cities. When an exemplar-dependent probability model is available, s(i, k) can be set to the log-likelihood of data point i given that its exemplar is point k. Alternatively, when appropriate, similarities may be set by hand. Rather than requiring that the number of clusters be prespecified, affinity propagation takes as input a real number s(k, k) for each data point k so that data points with larger values of s(k, k) are more likely to be chosen as exemplars. These values are referred to as "preferences." The number of identified exemplars (number of clusters) is influenced by the values of the input preferences, but also emerges from the message-passing procedure. If a priori, all data points are equally suitable as exemplars, the preferences should be set to a common value-this value can be varied to produce different numbers of clusters. The shared value could be the median of the input similarities (resulting in a moderate number of clusters) or their minimum (resulting in a small number of clusters). There are two kinds of message exchanged between data points, and each takes into account a different kind of competition. Messages can be combined at any stage to decide which points are exemplars and, for every other point, which exemplar it belongs to. The "responsibility" r(i, k), sent from data point i to candidate exemplar point k, reflects the accumulated evidence for how well-suited point k is to serve as the exemplar for point i, taking into account other potential exemplars for point i (Fig. 1B). The "availability" a(i, k), sent from candidate exemplar point k to point i, reflects the accumulated evidence for how appropriate it would be for point i to choose point k as its exemplar, taking into account the support from other points that point k should be an exemplar (Fig. 1C). r(i, k) and a(i, k) can be viewed as log-probability ratios. To begin with, the availabilities are initialized to zero: a(i, k) = 0. Then, the responsibilities are computed using the rule (1) In the first iteration, because the availabilities are zero, r(i, k) is set to the input similarity between point i and point k as its exemplar, minus the largest of the similarities between point i and other candidate exemplars. This competitive update is data-driven and does not take into account how many other points favor each candidate exemplar. In later iterations, when some points are effectively assigned to other exemplars, their availabilities will drop below zero as prescribed by the update rule below. These negative availabilities will decrease the effective values of some of the input similarities s(i, k') in the above rule, removing the corresponding candidate exemplars from competition. For k = i, the responsibility r(k, k) is set to the input preference that point k be chosen as an exemplar, s(k, k), minus the largest of the similarities between point i and all other candidate exemplars. This "self-responsibility" reflects accumulated evidence that point k is an exemplar, based on its input preference tempered by how ill-suited it is to be assigned to another exemplar. Whereas the above responsibility update lets all candidate exemplars compete for ownership of a data point, the following availability update gathers evidence from data points as to whether each candidate exemplar would make a good exemplar: (2) The availability a(i, k) is set to the self-responsibility r(k, k) plus the sum of the positive responsibilities candidate exemplar k receives from other points. Only the positive portions of incoming responsibilities are added, because it is only necessary for a good exemplar to explain some data points well (positive responsibilities), regardless of how poorly it explains other data points (negative responsibilities). If the self-responsibility r(k, k) is negative (indicating that point k is currently better suited as belonging to another exemplar rather than being an exemplar itself), the availability of point k as an exemplar can be increased if some other points have positive responsibilities for point k being their exemplar. To limit the influence of strong incoming positive responsibilities, the total sum is thresholded so that it cannot go above zero. The "self-availability" a(k, k) is updated differently: (3) This message reflects accumulated evidence that point k is an exemplar, based on the positive responsibilities sent to candidate exemplar k from other points. The above update rules require only simple, local computations that are easily implemented (2), and messages need only be exchanged between pairs of points with known similarities. At any point during affinity propagation, availabilities and responsibilities can be combined to identify exemplars. For point i, the value of k that maximizes a(i, k)+ r(i, k) either identifies point i as an exemplar if k = i, or identifies the data point that is the exemplar for point i. The message-passing procedure may be terminated after a fixed number of iterations, after changes in the messages fall below a threshold, or after the local decisions stay constant for some number of iterations. When updating the messages, it is important that they be damped to avoid numerical oscillations that arise in some circumstances. Each message is set to times its value from the previous iteration plus 1 - times its prescribed updated value, where the damping factor is between 0 and 1. In all of our experiments (3), we used a default damping factor of = 0.5, and each iteration of affinity propagation consisted of (i) updating all responsibilities given the availabilities, (ii) updating all availabilities given the responsibilities, and (iii) combining availabilities and responsibilities to monitor the exemplar decisions and terminate the algorithm when these decisions did not change for 10 iterations. Figure 1A shows the dynamics of affinity propagation applied to 25 two-dimensional data points (3), using negative squared error as the similarity. One advantage of affinity propagation is that the number of exemplars need not be specified beforehand. Instead, the appropriate number of exemplars emerges from the message-passing method and depends on the input exemplar preferences. This enables automatic model selection, based on a prior specification of how preferable each point is as an exemplar. Figure 1D shows the effect of the value of the common input preference on the number of clusters. This relation is nearly identical to the relation found by exactly minimizing the squared error (2). We next studied the problem of clustering images of faces using the standard optimization criterion of squared error. We used both affinity propagation and k-centers clustering to identify exemplars among 900 grayscale images extracted from the Olivetti face database (3). Affinity propagation found exemplars with much lower squared error than the best of 100 runs of k-centers clustering (Fig. 2A), which took about the same amount of computer time. We asked whether a huge number of random restarts of k-centers clustering could achieve the same squared error. Figure 2B shows the error achieved by one run of affinity propagation and the distribution of errors achieved by 10,000 runs of k-centers clustering, plotted against the number of clusters. Affinity propagation uniformly achieved much lower error in more than two orders of magnitude less time. Another popular optimization criterion is the sum of absolute pixel differences (which better tolerates outlying pixel intensities), so we repeated the above procedure using this error measure. Affinity propagation again uniformly achieved lower error (Fig. 2C). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2. Clustering faces. Exemplars minimizing the standard squared error measure of similarity were identified from 900 normalized face images (3). For a common preference of -600, affinity propagation found 62 clusters, and the average squared error was 108. For comparison, the best of 100 runs of k-centers clustering with different random initializations achieved a worse average squared error of 119. (A) The 15 images with highest squared error under either affinity propagation or k-centers clustering are shown in the top row. The middle and bottom rows show the exemplars assigned by the two methods, and the boxes show which of the two methods performed better for that image, in terms of squared error. Affinity propagation found higher-quality exemplars. (B) The average squared error achieved by a single run of affinity propagation and 10,000 runs of k-centers clustering, versus the number of clusters. The colored bands show different percentiles of squared error, and the number of exemplars corresponding to the result from (A) is indicated. (C) The above procedure was repeated using the sum of absolute errors as the measure of similarity, which is also a popular optimization criterion. Many tasks require the identification of exemplars among sparsely related data, i.e., where most similarities are either unknown or large and negative. To examine affinity propagation in this context, we addressed the task of clustering putative exons to find genes, using the sparse similarity matrix derived from microarray data andreported in (4). In that work, 75,066 segments of DNA (60 bases long) corresponding to putative exons were mined from the genome of mouse chromosome 1. Their transcription levels were measured across 12 tissue samples, and the similarity between every pair of putative exons (data points) was computed. The measure of similarity between putative exons was based on their proximity in the genome and the degree of coordination of their transcription levels across the 12 tissues. To account for putative exons that are not exons (e.g., introns), we included an additional artificial exemplar and determined the similarity of each other data point to this "nonexon exemplar" using statistics taken over the entire data set. The resulting 75,067 * 75,067 similarity matrix (3) consisted of 99.73% similarities with values of -, corresponding to distant DNA segments that could not possibly be part of the same gene. We applied affinity propagation to this similarity matrix, but because messages need not be exchanged between point i and k if s(i, k)= -, each iteration of affinity propagation required exchanging messages between only a tiny subset (0.27% or 15 million) of data point pairs. Figure 3A illustrates the identification of gene clusters and the assignment of some data points to the nonexon exemplar. The reconstruction errors for affinity propagation and k-centers clustering are compared in Fig. 3B. For each number of clusters, affinity propagation was run once and took 6 min, whereas k-centers clustering was run 10,000 times and took 208 hours. To address the question of how well these methods perform in detecting bona fide gene segments, Fig. 3C plots the true-positive (TP) rate against the false-positive (FP) rate, using the labels provided in the RefSeq database (5). Affinity propagation achieved significantly higher TP rates, especially at low FP rates, which are most important to biologists. At a FP rate of 3%, affinity propagation achieved a TP rate of 39%, whereas the best k-centers clustering result was 17%. For comparison, at the same FP rate, the best TP rate for hierarchical agglomerative clustering (2) was 19%, and the engineering tool described in (4), which accounts for additional biological knowledge, achieved a TP rate of 43%.

Here, squared error is not appropriate as a measure of similarity, but instead similarity values were derived from a cost function measuring proximity of the putative exons in the genome and co-expression of the putative exons across 12 tissue samples (3). (A) A small portion of the data and the emergence of clusters during each iteration of affinity propagation are shown. In each picture, the 100 boxes outlined in black correspond to 100 data points (from a total of 75,066 putative exons), and the 12 colored blocks in each box indicate the transcription levels of the corresponding DNA segment in 12 tissue samples. The box on the far left corresponds to an artificial data point with infinite preference that is used to account for nonexon regions (e.g., introns). Lines connecting data points indicate potential assignments, where gray lines indicate assignments that currently have weak evidence and solid lines indicate assignments that currently have strong evidence. (B) Performance on minimizing the reconstruction error of genes, for different numbers of detected clusters. For each number of clusters, affinity propagation took 6 min, whereas 10,000 runs of k-centers clustering took 208 hours on the same computer. In each case, affinity propagation achieved a significantly lower reconstruction error than k-centers clustering. (C) A plot of true-positive rate versus false-positive rate for detecting exons [using labels from RefSeq (5)] shows that affinity propagation also performs better at detecting biologically verified exons than k-centers clustering. Affinity propagation's ability to operate on the basis of nonstandard optimization criteria makes it suitable for exploratory data analysis using unusual measures of similarity. Unlike metric-space clustering techniques such as k-means clustering (1), affinity propagation can be applied to problems where the data do not lie in a continuous space. Indeed, it can be applied to problems where the similarities are not symmetric [i.e., s(i, k) s(k, i)] and to problems where the similarities do not satisfy the triangle inequality [i.e., s(i, k) = 0.8) different numbers of representative exemplar sentences (2), and the solution with four sentences is shown in Fig. 4A.

Affinity propagation can be used to explore the identification of exemplars on the basis of nonstandard optimization criteria. (A) Similarities between pairs of sentences in a draft of this manuscript were constructed by matching words. Four exemplar sentences were identified by affinity propagation and are shown. (B) Affinity propagation was applied to similarities derived from air-travel efficiency (measured by estimated travel time) between the 456 busiest commercial airports in Canada and the United States-the travel times for both direct flights (shown in blue) and indirect flights (not shown), including the mean transfer time of up to a maximum of one stopover, were used as negative similarities (3). (C) Seven exemplars identified by affinity propagation are color-coded, and the assignments of other cities to these exemplars is shown. Cities located quite near to exemplar cities may be members of other more distant exemplars due to the lack of direct flights between them (e.g., Atlantic City is 100 km from Philadelphia, but is closer in flight time to Atlanta). (D) The inset shows that the Canada-USA border roughly divides the Toronto and Philadelphia clusters, due to a larger availability of domestic flights compared to international flights. However, this is not the case on the west coast as shown in (E), because extraordinarily frequent airline service between Vancouver and Seattle connects Canadian cities in the northwest to Seattle. We also applied affinity propagation to explore the problem of identifying a restricted number of Canadian and American cities that are most easily accessible by large subsets of other cities, in terms of estimated commercial airline travel time. Each data point was a city, and the similarity s(i, k) was set to the negative time it takes to travel from city i to city k by airline, including estimated stopover delays (3). Due to headwinds, the transit time was in many cases different depending on the direction of travel, so that 36% of the similarities were asymmetric. Further, for 97% of city pairs i and k, there was a third city j such that the triangle inequality was violated, because the trip from i to k included a long stopover delay in city j so it took longer than the sum of the durations of the trips from i to j and j to k. When the number of "most accessible cities" was constrained to be seven (by adjusting the input preference appropriately), the cities shown in Fig. 4, B to E, were identified. It is interesting that several major cities were not selected, either because heavy international travel makes them inappropriate as easily accessible domestic destinations (e.g., New York City, Los Angeles) or because their neighborhoods can be more efficiently accessed through other destinations (e.g., Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Minneapolis account for Chicago's destinations, while avoiding potential airport delays). Affinity propagation can be viewed as a method that searches for minima of an energy function (7) that depends on a set of N hidden labels, c1,..., cN, corresponding to the N data points. Each label indicates the exemplar to which the point belongs, so that s(i, ci) is the similarity of data point i to its exemplar. ci = i is a special case indicating that point i is itself an exemplar, so that s(i, ci) is the input preference for point i. Not all configurations of the labels are valid; a configuration c is valid when for every point i, if some other point i' has chosen i as its exemplar (i.e., ci' = i), then i must be an exemplar (i.e., ci = i). The energy of a valid configuration is . Exactly minimizing the energy is computationally intractable, because a special case of this minimization problem is the NP-hard k-median problem (8). However, the update rules for affinity propagation correspond to fixed-point recursions for minimizing a Bethe free-energy (9) approximation. Affinity propagation is most easily derived as an instance of the max-sum algorithm in a factor graph (10) describing the constraints on the labels and the energy function (2). In some degenerate cases, the energy function may have multiple minima with corresponding multiple fixed points of the update rules, and these may prevent convergence. For example, if s(1, 2) = s(2, 1) and s(1, 1) = s(2, 2), then the solutions c1 = c2 =1 and c1 = c2 = 2 both achieve the same energy. In this case, affinity propagation may oscillate, with both data points alternating between being exemplars and nonexemplars. In practice, we found that oscillations could always be avoided by adding a tiny amount of noise to the similarities to prevent degenerate situations, or by increasing the damping factor. Affinity propagation has several advantages over related techniques. Methods such as k-centers clustering (1), k-means clustering (1), and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm (11) store a relatively small set of estimated cluster centers at each step. These techniques are improved upon by methods that begin with a large number of clusters and then prune them (12), but they still rely on random sampling and make hard pruning decisions that cannot be recovered from. In contrast, by simultaneously considering all data points as candidate centers and gradually identifying clusters, affinity propagation is able to avoid many of the poor solutions caused by unlucky initializations and hard decisions. Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques (13) randomly search for good solutions, but do not share affinity propagation's advantage of considering many possible solutions all at once. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (14) and spectral clustering (15) solve the quite different problem of recursively comparing pairs of points to find partitions of the data. These techniques do not require that all points within a cluster be similar to a single center and are thus not well-suited to many tasks. In particular, two points that should not be in the same cluster may be grouped together by an unfortunate sequence of pairwise groupings. In (8), it was shown that the related metric k-median problem could be relaxed to form a linear program with a constant factor approximation. There, the input was assumed to be metric, i.e., nonnegative, symmetric, and satisfying the triangle inequality. In contrast, affinity propagation can take as input general nonmetric similarities. Affinity propagation also provides a conceptually new approach that works well in practice. Whereas the linear programming relaxation is hard to solve and sophisticated software packages need to be applied (e.g., CPLEX), affinity propagation makes use of intuitive message updates that can be implemented in a few lines of code (2). Affinity propagation is related in spirit to techniques recently used to obtain record-breaking results in quite different disciplines (16). The approach of recursively propagating messages (17) in a "loopy graph" has been used to approach Shannon's limit in error-correcting decoding (18, 19), solve random satisfiability problems with an order-of-magnitude increase in size (20), solve instances of the NP-hard two-dimensional phase-unwrapping problem (21), and efficiently estimate depth from pairs of stereo images (22). Yet, to our knowledge, affinity propagation is the first method to make use of this idea to solve the age-old, fundamental problem of clustering data. Because of its simplicity, general applicability, and performance, we believe affinity propagation will prove to be of broad value in science and engineering.
Abstract Granitic plutonism is the principal agent of crustal differentiation, but linking granite emplacement to crust formation requires knowledge of the magmatic evolution, which is notoriously difficult to reconstruct from bulk rock compositions. We unlocked the plutonic archive through hafnium (Hf) and oxygen (O) isotope analysis of zoned zircon crystals from the classic hornblende-bearing (I-type) granites of eastern Australia. This granite type forms by the reworking of sedimentary materials by mantle-like magmas instead of by remelting ancient metamorphosed igneous rocks as widely believed. I-type magmatism thus drives the coupled growth and differentiation of continental crust. Earth's veneer of continental crust is unique among the known terrestrial planetsand atteststo a distinctive mode of planetary differentiation (1). The vast granitic batholiths and their erupted analogs that dominate continental landmasses are an obvious manifestation of such differentiation. Yet how granites relate to crustal growth processes remains puzzling, because the majority of these rocks have isotope signatures that preclude a direct mantle ancestry (2-6). The paradigm from studies in the Lachlan Fold Belt (eastern Australia) is that granitic magmas derive from preexisting sources that are fundamentally either supracrustal (formed originally at Earth's surface) or infracrustal (igneous rocks that solidified at depth) in character, as reflected in the S- and I-type notation used to describe them (7). Granites of I-type affinity are globally prevalent. A corollary of the I-S type concept is that the isotope compositions of granites reflect the crustal residence prehistory of their protoliths (4), constraining the age and architecture of the deep crust as well as the timing of ancient crust-forming episodes. In contrast, other studies attribute the isotope variations to interaction between older crust and mantle-derived magma (2, 5, 6, 8), implying that crustal growth is intrinsic to granitic emplacement. Mixing models are controversial (9), because ascertaining the timing and magnitude of mantle input is impeded by difficulties with retrieving the record of magmatic evolution from bulk granite compositions. This record is, however, preserved within the chemical and isotope stratigraphy of certain minerals (10-13). The robust accessory mineral zircon has the advantage that its intricate growth zoning can be dated by U-Pb isotopes, and it tracks changing melt chemistry in its Hf and O isotope ratios (13, 14). We report an integrated in situ U-Pb, Hf, and O isotope study of zircons from granites, in this case the Lachlan I-types, to decipher the crustal evolutionary processes attending silicic magmatism. We examined zircon crystals from three granitic suites (groups of rocks related through common geochemical trends): Jindabyne [415 million years ago (Ma)], Why Worry (400 Ma), and Cobargo (390 Ma). The Jindabyne plutons intrude Silurian (1/2425 Ma) S-type granites, whereas the Why Worry and Cobargo rocks are emplaced into Ordovician metasedimentary units at a depth of around 10 to 12 km. Rocks of each granitic suite have hallmark I-type features in their abundance of hornblende and in having higher concentrations of Ca, Na, and Sr than do S-type granites of similar silica content (7). Samples at either end of the compositional range of each suite were targeted. Zircons were also separated from a mafic rock associated with each suite, these being a gabbro (Jindabyne), synplutonic dolerite dyke (Why Worry), and diorite enclave (Cobargo). The mafic rocks are coeval with the respective granitic suites andshare the same distinctive chemical features (15, 16), implying consanguinity. The zircons of all samples were first dated by ion microprobe U-Pb isotope analysis (table S1). This identified a minor inherited (pre-magmatic) component in some samples (15), but the discussion below focuses on data obtained from the magmatic portion of each zircon. O isotope compositions (18O/16O, expressed as 18O) (17) were determined from the same zircon growth zone using a Cameca IMS 1270 ion microprobe (18) (table S2). Unlike bulk rock samples, zircon is extremely retentive of the magmatic O isotope ratio (19), and zircons in equilibrium with pristine mantle-derived melts have a narrow range of 18O [5.3 0.3 per mil ()] (14). This range is insensitive to magmatic differentiation, because the attendant rise in bulk rock 18O is compensated for by an increase in zircon/liquid 18O fractionation from +0.5 for mafic melts to +1.5 for silicic derivatives (14). Values of 18O in zircon above 5.6 thus fingerprint an 18O-enriched supracrustal component in the magma from which the zircon crystallized, this being either sedimentary rock (10 to 30) or altered volcanic rock (to 20) (20). The 176Hf/177Hf ratios were measured by laser ablation multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (18) (table S3), targeting, wherever possible, the pits generated by ion microprobe analysis. An important feature of the Hf isotope data (Fig. 1) is the spectrum of mu Hf values exhibited by zircons of the same rock (up to 10 mu units) (21). Such variations within a single sample can only be reconciled by the operation of open-system processes that are capable of shifting the 176Hf/177Hf ratio of the melt from which the zircons precipitated. To identify these processes, it is necessary to deduce the polarity of Hf isotope change during zircon growth. This can be accomplished by examination of intracrystal isotope zoning trends and by pairing the isotope variations with trace element ratios (such as Th/U) that are proxies for the degree of differentiation. In cases where isotope zoning is pronounced, 176Hf/177Hf generally decreases toward zircon rims, although some grains show the opposite pattern. Trace element microanalysis has established that Th/U ratios typically fall from core to rim in the studied zircons (table S1), and the mu Hf values of the zircons also decrease systematically with Th/U (Fig. 2). We interpret this as evidence for a progressive reduction in the 176Hf/177Hf ratio during the magmatic evolution of each suite, as would be induced by the addition of an unradiogenic (continental crust-like) component. The reversely zoned zircons manifest episodic input from material with higher mu Hf values. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

Hf isotopic compositions of zircons from each suite plotted against the Th/U ratio measured for the same part of the crystal. Arrowed lines show the sense of core-to-rim zonation for individual zircons. Coupling the 176Hf/177Hf ratios of the zircons with their O isotope compositions reveals the nature of the crustal component. Zircons of individual samples exhibit a 18O range of 2 to 4, and, although rarely resolvable, intragrain heterogeneity can exceed 1 and involves a rise in 18O from core to rim (table S2). mu Hf and 18O are correlated for zircons of each suite and define curved arrays that extend to much higher 18O values than those of zircons precipitated from mantle melts (Fig. 3). These elevated 18O values diagnose a substantial supracrustal component in the Lachlan I-type granites. The isotope array defined by zircons of each suite has a distinctive trajectory anchored by a different low-18O end member that is in equilibrium with mantle O. For Jindabyne and Why Worry, this corresponds to zircons of the associated mafic intrusives. At higher 18O values, the arrays converge toward the field defined by magmatic zircons of S-type granites and the inferred Hf-O isotope composition of the metasedimentary country rocks.

Plot of 18O versus mu Hf for zircons of this study, showing the putative curves corresponding to magma evolution by crustal assimilation-crystallization (AFC) (23).

The 18O value of Lachlan metasedimentary rock is taken from (33), and the shaded field depicts the isotope compositions of zircons from the Lachlan S-type granites.

VSMOW, Vienna standard mean ocean water; LFB metased. rock, Lachlan Fold Belt metasedimentary rock. The covariant mu Hf-18O zircon arrays are therefore tracking the progressive interaction between two end-member components during zircon crystallization, these being parental low-18O magmas and metasedimentary-derived materials. Such interaction could involve either mixing and hybridization with crustal partial melts or the digestion of supracrustal rock (assimilation) by low-18O magmas. The origin of the low-18O magmas is not uniquely constrained by the zircon isotope arrays. The data are permissive of an enriched mantle heritage or an infracrustal progenitor, or of variable combinations of the two (8). A predominantly mantle derivation accords with the mafic character of the inferred low-18O components. These mafic magmas were subsequently modified by crustal contamination, as is evident in the spread of zircon mu Hf and 18O values in the Jindabyne gabbro and Why Worry basalt (Fig. 3), but zircon crystallized sufficiently early to retain vestiges of the original isotope signature. Although long suspected (5), a mixed and partly supracrustal source for the Lachlan I-type granites is now incontrovertible. Major supracrustal input has also recently been inferred for other 18O-enriched circum-Pacific I-type plutons (22). The remaining task is to quantify the metasedimentary component of each Lachlan suite and to determine the conditions under which this was incorporated. Assuming that assimilation-fractional crystallization equations (23) are a reasonable approximation of magmatic evolution, most zircons in the Cobargo Suite precipitated from melts containing up to 25% supracrustal material, the corresponding figures being around 40% for Jindabyne and 60% for Why Worry (Fig. 3 and supporting online text). The geometry of the mu Hf-18O arrays places additional constraints on the mixing or assimilation process, because the curvature of these arrays is controlled by the relative Hf concentrations of the end members. For Cobargo and Jindabyne, the Hf content of the low-18O magma must have exceeded that of the crustal component, as would be the case if the latter were a partial melt with residual zircon. Conversely, the concave-up trend defined by the Why Worry suite zircons requires that the supracrustal ingredient had the higher Hf concentration, which is consistent with bulk assimilation. Partially disaggregated metasedimentary enclaves in these plutons provide evidence for this process (15). Petrogenetic models for the Lachlan I-type granites must reconcile two key aspects of the new data. First, the Hf-O isotope arrays extend to mantle-like values, indicating that zircon crystallization commenced before the ingestion of supracrustal material. However, the initial temperatures of the parental low-18O magmas were inevitably higher than the zircon stability field, typically C (24), and crustal incorporation is more effective for hot liquid magmas (25). We therefore infer that crustal assimilation and zircon precipitation occurred at different temperatures, and thus crustal levels, for part of the magmatic history. Second, the diversity of mu Hf and 18O values indicates that zircons of each granite sampled radically different melt compositions, yet they are now juxtaposed within the same rock volume. This demands a process in the plutonic environment that can unite crystals with disparate petrogenetic histories. Many volcanic rocks also comprise aggregates of crystals formed at different times from evolving melt compositions (10, 12, 26). The following scenario is proposed (Fig. 4), accommodating the view that plutons are assembled incrementally (27, 28). We envisage a dynamic dual-level process involving the incomplete solidification of basaltic magmas in a deep crustal hot zone (18O and lower mu Hf values, as recorded by the zircon isotope arrays. Zircons with disparate isotope signatures are juxtaposed by mingling and crystal exchange between melt batches during pluton assembly and intrareservoir crystal-liquid sorting (27, 31). Mixing with the recharge melt would also drive the resident magma and its crystallizing zircon cargo toward higher 18O and lower mu Hf values, explaining the intrazircon isotope zoning. Isotopic reversals in some zircons and basalt injection in the Why Worry plutons suggest that this evolution was punctuated by juvenile magma replenishments. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 4. A schematic model for the formation of I-type granites in eastern Australia, based on the analysis of Hf-O isotopes in zircon. Silicic melts are generated at depth through interaction between residual liquids from basalt crystallization and melts derived from the overlying supracrustal assemblage (29). These hybrid magmas are extracted to ascend and pond in the shallow crust to crystallize zircons whose isotopic signature records the progress of supracrustal incorporation at depth. Mingling and amalgamation of melt batches during protopluton assembly accumulate zircons with different isotope characteristics. Basaltic emplacement is localized at the interface between the mafic (oceanic) substrate to the eastern Lachlan Fold Belt and the overlying turbidite pile; the interface is likely to represent a substantial rheological contrast. The refined view of granite genesis captured by the zircon isotope data compels a reappraisal of the I-S type concept and its implications for crustal evolution. In revealing the reworking of supracrustal material by juvenile magmas, our study suggests that I-type magmatism critically involves continental growth, this being camouflaged to some extent by the non-mantle-like isotope ratios of the bulk rocks. The overall proportion of new material added by the Lachlan I-type suites was near 85% for Cobargo, 70% for Jindabyne, and 50% for Why Worry. These estimates imply that Phanerozoic crust generation rates may have been higher than hitherto appreciated from studies of plutonic terranes (6, 32), modifying global continental growth curves through time.
Abstract Color observations from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal zones of localized fluid alteration (cementation and bleaching) along joints within layered deposits in western Candor Chasma, Mars. This fluid alteration occurred within the subsurface in the geologic past and has been exposed at the surface through subsequent erosion. These findings demonstrate that fluid flow along fractures was a mechanism by which subsurface fluids migrated through these layered deposits. Fractured layered deposits are thus promising sites for investigating the geologic history of water on Mars. The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera (1, 2) on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has returned images of the surface of Mars that have exceptional clarity and resolution. One of the first images of Mars returned by HiRISE in the low (250 to 315 km) mapping orbit is of the layered deposits within western Candor Chasma (Fig. 1 and fig. S1), one of the larger canyons of the Valles Marineris system, in the western equatorial region of Mars (fig. S2). Surface features 0.26 m (equivalent to one pixel) are detectable, and the shapes of objects 0.78 m across are resolved (2). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. High-resolution enhanced-color image showing a landscape of sand dunes and buttes against a background of light-toned (tan) and dark-toned (blue) bands in Candor Chasma. This is a subscene from HiRISE image TRA_000836_1740, which was acquired on 30 September 2006 (Mars southern winter). The image was taken at the local Mars time of 3:29 p.m., and the scene was illuminated from the west with a solar incidence angle of 58.5. The HiRISE camera collected image data in three band passes (blue-green, red, and near-infrared; 400 to 1000 nm) (1, 2). The image scale is 0.26 m per pixel, which is equivalent to the scale of the red band-pass image. The other band passes were acquired with two-by-two pixel binning to 0.52 m per pixel. The complete image is centered at -5.7 latitude, 284.6E longitude (planetocentric, International Astronomical Union 2000). The layered deposits appear as alternating light- and dark-toned bands (Fig. 1 and fig. S1) and may be volcanic, eolian, or lacustrine in origin (3-6). The dark bands appear to be flatlying in many areas at the 10-m scale. Many of the dark-toned bands consist of a mixture of meter-scale boulders of light-toned material and finer-grained dark material (figs. S3 and S4). The patches of fine-grained dark material commonly have a hummocky texture that is consistent with ripples of 1/22 to 5 m in wavelength (fig. S3). Evidence of recent eolian activity is pervasive throughout the scene [supporting online material (SOM) text]. Therefore, this flat-lying dark material is interpreted as surficial deposits of sediment composed of eolian sand, with a possible component of lag. Dark material within the underlying bedrock may also contribute to the tone of the dark bands. The source of the dark-toned sediment is unconstrained by the present study, but it may be present within the underlying bedrock and became mobilized through eolian erosion or persists in place as lag deposits. Dark material may also have been transported from a distal source. Local topography and high surface roughness of select layers within the light-toned bedrock apparently contribute to the accumulation of the dark sediment in distinct bands (figs. S3 to S5). The dark-toned bands are commonly found within topographic depressions in the underlying bedrock. Accumulations of boulders also act to trap dark-toned sediment within the bands (SOM text). Thus, the dark-toned bands appear to consist of sediment that has accumulated within the troughs between ridges of light-toned bedrock. This ridge-and-trough morphology is consistent with differential erosion, which can be expected if the bedrock is mechanically layered. That is, the mechanically weaker layers of rock have faster erosion rates than the stronger layers. Assuming a homogeneous digenetic history, fine-grained layers are stronger than coarse-grained layers within the same sedimentary deposit (7). The coarser-grained layers erode faster than the finer-grained layers, resulting in a ridge-and-trough morphology as suggested here. Local heterogeneities in cementation and chemical weathering may also influence rock strength (8-10). Thus, the ridges and troughs within the bedrock may reflect local variations in either grain size or diagenetic history, or both. Also present are sets of fractures that are hundreds of meters to several kilometers in length (Figs. 1 and 2 and fig. S3). Shear displacements of crosscut bedding and other discontinuities are not observed along these fractures. Small horizontal displacements of more than 0.52 m (two pixels) would be clearly observed at the resolution of the HiRISE image. Therefore, these fractures are identified as joints rather than faults (SOM text). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2. (A to C) Examples of joints and surrounding halos of light-toned bedrock. The joints are the thin dark lineations. The scale bar and north arrow apply to each panel. Many joints are surrounded by a nearly continuous "halo" of light-toned bedrock that cuts across the dark-toned bands (Fig. 2 and figs. S3 and S4). These joint halos are interrupting the background pattern of sediment patches, or topographic depressions, and any layers of bedrock that are dark. The lack of dark material points to a negligible accumulation of dark sediment along these halos, as well as a systematic lightening of any dark layers of bedrock within these halos. The negligible amount of dark material along the joint halos indicates that these areas are unfavorable for sediment deposition. A lack of meter-scale topographic shading along the bedrock within the halos reveals that these surfaces are smooth at the meter scale. In contrast, the adjacent light-toned bands show clear topographic shading that is distinguishable from albedo variations through HiRISE's color capability (Fig. 2 and figs. S3 and S4). The surface along the joint halos is therefore interpreted to be smoother at the meter scale relative to the adjacent light- and dark-toned bands. A smoother ground surface means a lack of small-scale topography that can act to trap sediment. Patterns of topographic shading also indicate that the joint halos often have a positive relief with inclined surfaces that would tend to impede sediment accumulation. By analogy with the light-toned bands, the accumulation of dark sediment along the trace of the joint can be inhibited where the halos are ridgelike. A ridgelike morphology for the joint halos requires the bedrock along the joints to have been strengthened against erosion. Ridgelike segments of the halos that crosscut the dark-toned bands of sediment especially need to be strengthened because, presumably, these dark bands lie along mechanically weaker (more-eroded) layers of bedrock. The combination of a smooth surface and positive relief along the joint halos accounts for the lack of accumulated dark sediment and indicates that the bedrock within these halos is stronger (more indurated) than the more readily eroded bedrock around it. Chemical precipitation of minerals (e.g., Fe-bearing minerals) (11-13) from fluids circulating within pore spaces of the rock along the haloed joints is a likely mechanism of wall-rock strengthening. These minerals act to cement the wall rock and thereby increase the rock's resistance to pitting and erosion. These halos most plausibly formed after the joints were present. Had the halos formed first as nonfractured mechanically strong ridges, the joints would have preferentially propagated within the weaker rock adjacent to those halos, rather than through the center of the halos as is observed. Preexisting joints would also facilitate the localization of bleaching and cementation within distinct linear halos by acting as conduits for circulating fluids. In the absence of fracture-controlled fluid flow, diagenetic alteration would be distributed throughout the rock mass rather than being localized in discrete zones that crosscut bedding (e.g., 11-16). The systematic lightening in tone of any dark bedrock layers along the halos points to geochemical bleaching of the bedrock. As previously mentioned, dark material may contribute to the appearance of the dark-toned bands, especially on slopes. However, dark bedrock is lacking within the joint halos. Thus, any dark material originally present within the bedrock appears to have been dissolved or geochemically altered within the halos. On Earth, the bleaching of the rock surrounding a fracture is a clear indication of chemical interactions between the fluids circulating within that fracture and the host rock (11, 12). Additionally, interactions between the wall rock and the fluids flowing through the fracture induce changes in the strength of the wall rock (8-10). Fracture-supported flow is recognized as an important process that facilitates the large-scale subsurface migration of fluids and chemical interactions between these fluids and the host rock (8, 9, 15, 16). The strengthening of the joints' wall rock, as well as the geochemical bleaching of this rock, provides strong evidence of subsurface fluids having circulated through this section of the layered deposits. These episodes of bleaching and cementation probably reflect episodes of reducing and oxidizing fluid flow, as is commonly observed on Earth (11-13) and also on Mars (17-19). These results support previous findings from the Observatoire pour la Mineralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces, et l'Activite (OMEGA) hyperspectral imager on board Mars Express. OMEGA observations of this region of the layered deposits reveal the spectral signature of hydrated sulfates, which is viewed as evidence of past aqueous activity (20, 21). Not all joints in this scene have halos (fig. S5). This is probably because of a difference in age for the haloed versus "non-haloed" joints. Halos developed around joints that were present when subsurface fluids were circulating through the currently exposed level of the bedrock. Once the bulk of the subsurface fluids drained from this area, any new joints that formed would not have supported adequate fluid flow for a sufficient amount of time to allow for the strengthening and bleaching of the wall rock to occur; thus, no halo is present. Therefore, the presence of halos may be a proxy for relative fracture age, with the haloed fractures being the oldest and the non-haloed fractures being the youngest and having formed after the subsurface fluids drained from this level of the bedrock. The presence of non-haloed joints that apparently postdate the haloed joints indicates that halo formation, and thus circulation of subsurface fluids within these joints, was not a geologically recent event. Further, had the haloed joints supported geologically recent near-surface fluid flow, fluvial erosional and depositional structures would be apparent (22, 23). Such morphologic evidence for recent subaerial fluid flow (e.g., gullies and spring mounds) is not observed. Thus, the present-day exposures of the haloed joints initially formed within the subsurface as fluids circulated through the layered deposits. These fluids subsequently drained away, and the haloed joints were exposed at the surface through erosion. Therefore, evidence of geochemical processes that once occurred within the subsurface is currently exposed at the surface in the form of these haloed joints. A current focus of Mars surface exploration is the investigation of areas that show evidence of past hydrologic activity, with the intent of characterizing the past habitability of these areas and their potential to support life. Much attention has been paid to classic volatile-related terrains such as dry river- and lakebeds and paleo-springs. This study demonstrates that exhumed joints and faults are also promising areas in which to investigate past hydrologic activity. In addition to Fig. 1, haloed joints are observed in other HiRISE images of equatorial layered deposits in Valles Marineris and elsewhere. Further analyses of these fractures may yield additional insight into the geochemistry that drives the bleaching and cementation of the wall rock. Detailed surface observations of fracture-controlled fluid flow may be possible with the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity. A separate HiRISE image of Victoria Crater in Meridiani Planum reveals a set of subparallel linear ridges along the crater's eastern rim and floor (fig. S6). These ridges are stratigraphically located within the regional layered sedimentary bedrock. The linearity, common orientation, and positive relief of these features suggest that these are fractures that are surrounded by bedrock that has beenchemically cemented or otherwise indurated, similar to the joints described here in Candor Chasma. Opportunity is currently at Victoria Crater, and detailed studies of these ridges may provide additional insight into the mechanics and chemistry of paleo-fluid flow through the regional sedimentary bedrock.
Abstract Chili peppers (Capsicum spp.) are widely cultivated food plants that arose in the Americas and are now incorporated into cuisines worldwide. Here, we report a genus-specific starch morphotype that provides a means to identify chili peppers from archaeological contexts and trace both their domestication and dispersal. These starch microfossils have been found at seven sites dating from 6000 years before present to European contact and ranging from the Bahamas to southern Peru. The starch grain assemblages demonstrate that maize and chilies occurred together as an ancient and widespread Neotropical plant food complex that predates pottery in some regions. Chili peppers, members of the genus Capsicum, have been cultivated extensively, initially in the Americas and, after Columbus, around the globe (1, 2). The lack of a comprehensive archaeobotanical record has hampered accurate reconstructions of the origins, domestications, and dispersals of these plants. Macroremains of the fruits are confined to rare sites in arid environments, and reports of seeds and pollen are even less common (Table 1). We found that a widespread, but previously unidentified archaeological starch morphotype is derived from chili pepper fruits and is commonly preserved on artifacts. We documented this microfossil from seven archaeological sites ranging from the Bahamas archipelago to Andean South America (Fig. 1) beginning 6000 years ago (Table 2).

The five most economically notable species of chili pepper are C. annuum, C. baccatum, C. chinense, C. frutescens, and C. pubescens. Although it is generally agreed that the genus Capsicum originated in Bolivia (2), the centers of domestication and dispersal patterns of these species remain speculative. A combination of archaeological evidence, genetic analyses, and modern plant distributions have led researchers to suggest that C. annuum was initially domesticated in Mexico or northern Central America, C. frutescens in the Caribbean, C. baccatum in lowland Bolivia, C. chinense in northern lowland Amazonia, and C. pubescens in the mid-elevation southern Andes (2, 3). All five species of domesticated chili peppers produce large, flattened lenticular starch grains with a shallow central depression, not unlike a red blood cell in appearance (Fig. 2, A to C). When rotated into side view, a central linear figure-a clean line or split figure with sharp edges-runs parallel to the long axis of the grain. This figure can extend for the entire length of the grain or just a part of it (Fig. 2, E and F). Ranging from about 13 to 45 1/2m in length, the starches of domesticated peppers are easily distinguishable from smaller wild types in the microfossil record (Fig. 2D and table S1). Although the basic three-dimensional morphology is consistent among all species of Capsicum, micromorphological characters differ between species.

This starch granule is typical of those from wild peppers. (E) Side view of a modern starch granule from Capsicum baccatum. Note the linear figure. (F) Side view of an archaeological starch granule of Capsicum from Zapotal. Three of the species-C. baccatum, C. frutescens, and C. pubescens-can be identified on the basis of diagnostic morphotypes that have unique features of the central depression. However, these features are rare even in modern starch grain assemblages. Otherwise, the morphologies of starch grain assemblages from C. annuum and C. frutescens are so similar that, in the absence of a diagnostic, it is not possible to assign grains to a single species. The morphology of starch from C. chinense is similar to but not identical to that of C. annuum or C. frutescens, and the morphologies of all three starches differ significantly from those of C. baccatum and C. pubescens which, in turn, differ from one another. Because similar types occur in all congeneric species of Capsicum, either a diagnostic or a large archaeobotanical assemblage is required for a secure species identification. The presence of a basic genus-diagnostic starch morphotype for Capsicum is predictable because of the lack of perfect barriers to intraspecific hybridization (4). C. annuum, C. chinense, and C. frutescens have been described as a species complex with a single ancestral gene pool (4). Therefore, it is not surprising that the starches of these three species are morphologically similar to one another. In contrast, C. baccatum and C. pubescens are distinct domesticated species in South America (4). Starches derived from other economically significant species in the Solanaceae including Lycianthes, the genus that recent phylogenetic studies indicate is the most closely related to Capsicum (5), differ from those of chili peppers (table S1 and fig. S1) (6). Thus, we have eliminated those plant species with the potential to confuse the source of the microfossils. We recovered securely identified genus-diagnostic Capsicum starch microfossils from seven sites throughout the Americas. The oldest positively identified starches were found at the contemporaneous sites of Loma Alta and Real Alto in southwestern Ecuador. Interpreted as a village-sized, permanent settlement, Loma Alta was occupied for more than a millennium beginning about 6100 years before present (yr B.P.) (7). We recovered chili pepper starches from sediment samples, milling stones, and food residues from ceramic sherds of cooking vessels, all of which were excavated from the lower levels of the site. Similar to Loma Alta, Real Alto was a village site at about 6100 yr B.P.; however, by about 4750 yr B.P., it had expanded into a regional ritual-ceremonial center (8, 9). The chili starches were extracted from milling stones from two house floors dating to the period of expansion. Microfossil evidence of maize, Canna edulis (achira), Maranta arundinacea (arrowroot), Calathea sp. (leren), manioc, cucurbits (squash), Canavalia sp. (jack bean), and the Arecaceae family (palms) has also been recovered from Real Alto (10-12). A combination of evidence, including plant remains and site proximity to seasonally flooded bottomland, indicates that agriculture was important in the economies of both Ecuadorian sites. Ecuador is not considered to be the center of domestication for any of the five major economic species of chili peppers. Therefore, the presence of domesticated chilies within this early, complex, agricultural system indicates that these plants must have been domesticated elsewhere earlier than 6000 yr B.P. and brought into the region from either the north or the south. In central Panama, the Aguadulce Rock Shelter was occupied from about 13,000 to 3200 yr B.P. during both the Preceramic and Early Ceramic periods (13). The site has yielded evidence for the cultivation of other plants not native to southern Central America, including maize, manioc, and squashes dating from about 9000 to 5800 yr B.P. We identified chili pepper starch on a groundstone tool recovered from the top of the preceramic deposits; the tool and thus its associated starch residues have a stratigraphic date of about 5600 yr B.P. This artifact also yielded starch grains from maize and domesticated yam (13). The occupation of the coastal shell-midden site of Zapotal coincides with the Early Ceramic period of this region of Panama, beginning about 4800 yr B.P. (14). We recovered starches of chilies from groundstone tools, indicating that the peppers were processed and consumed alongside a number of other domesticates at the site, including maize, manioc, and yams (15). By this time, swidden cultivation of several domesticated species, including maize and manioc, was well established in the region, and farmers had significantly deforested the foothills near both Panamanian sites (16). Thus, the Panamanian record documents the use of domesticated chilies as components of the diet of swidden agriculturists in both Preceramic and Ceramic era groups. Farther south at 3600 m in the Peruvian Andes lies the site of Waynuna, a Late Preceramic house occupied beginning about 4000 yr B.P. At Waynuna, we found chili starches on processing tools in association with maize, arrowroot, and the remains of what is likely Solanum sp. (potato) (17). These data indicate that the residents of Waynuna were cultivating maize, tubers, and peppers and were processing them into food on site. Waynuna yielded the only starch assemblage that contained a species-diagnostic morphotype. These chili pepper starches appeared to be derived from C. pubescens, the species that includes varieties such as the rocoto pepper, a chili that is cultivated at mid-altitude in the Andes (2). When combined with macrofossil evidence (Table 1), the starch data indicate that the cultivation of three domesticated species of chili pepper was contemporaneous on the coast and in the highlands of Peru as early as 4000 yr B.P. in the Late Preceramic period. The presence of numerous other cultivars within the assemblages of each region indicates that sophisticated agriculture was practiced in both regions before the introduction of pottery. We also found starches of chili peppers at the Three Dog site located on San Salvador Island in the Bahamas. This site was occupied by a group of fisher-horticulturists about 1000 yr B.P. Representing the material remains of at least one household, the site consists of a midden, two activity areas, and a low-density (well-swept) area. Fifty-eight chert microliths, all typical of the morphology commonly described as manioc grater flakes (18-20), have been recovered, as were ceramic griddle sherds. The microliths yielded the starchy remains of both maize and unidentified roots or tubers. We recovered chili starches from two flakes that also contained starches of maize. Lastly, we recovered microfossil evidence for chili pepper at Los Mangos del Parguaza in Venezuela, a large habitation site occupied about 500 to 1000 yr B.P. (21). Several large, deep stone metates were scattered over the surface of the site. Excavation of a midden deposit yielded ceramic griddle sherds and microlithic flakes that are often associated with manioc processing (22). As at the Three Dog site, the remains of manioc are conspicuously absent from an excavation that yielded artifacts usually associated with manioc processing (22). The same processing tools that contained starches of chili pepper also contained remains of maize. Root crops, including arrowroot, Myrosma sp. (guapo), and a member of the Zingiberaceae family (ginger) also left their starchy remains. When combined with the data from the Three Dog site, the chili pepper microfossils from Los Mangos del Parguaza support the notion that a sophisticated mixed subsistence economy of both root and seed crops occurred at these sites that were initially categorized as being occupied by manioc horticulturists (23). Neither microfossils typical of wild species nor transitional forms of Capsicum were recovered from any site. The presence of domesticated plants used as condiments rather than as staple foods during the Preceramic period indicates that sophisticated agriculture and complex cuisines arose early throughout the Americas and that the exploitation of maize, root crops, and chili peppers spread before the introduction of pottery. Evidence from both macrobotanical and microbotanical remains indicates that once chili peppers became incorporated into the diet, they persisted. Apart from the chili peppers, maize is present at every site we sampled. Maize and chilies occur together from the onset of this record until European contact and, thus, represent an ancient Neotropical plant food complex.
Abstract Chemoautotrophic endosymbionts are the metabolic cornerstone of hydrothermal vent communities, providing invertebrate hosts with nearly all of their nutrition. The Calyptogena magnifica (Bivalvia: Vesicomyidae) symbiont, Candidatus Ruthia magnifica, is the first intracellular sulfur-oxidizing endosymbiont to have its genome sequenced, revealing a suite of metabolic capabilities. The genome encodes major chemoautotrophic pathways as well as pathways for biosynthesis of vitamins, cofactors, and all 20 amino acids required by the clam. Metazoans at deep-sea hydrothermal vents flourish with the support of symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria (1). Analogous to photosynthetic chloroplasts, which evolved from cyanobacterial ancestors and use light energy to fix carbon for their plant and algal hosts, chemoautotrophic endosymbionts use the chemical energy of reduced sulfur emanating from vents to provide their hosts with carbon and a large array of additional necessary nutrients. In return, host invertebrates bridge the oxic-anoxic interface to provide symbiotic bacteria with the inorganic substrates necessary for chemoautotrophy. The giant clam, Calyptogena magnifica Boss and Turner (Bivalvia: Vesicomyidae), was one of the first organisms described after the discovery of hydrothermal vents (2). It has a reduced gut and ciliary food groove and is nutritionally dependent on its -proteobacterial symbionts (here named Candidatus Ruthia magnifica) (3, 4). We present the complete genome of Ruthia magnifica (Fig. 1). Despite having a relatively small genome (1.2 Mb), R. magnifica is predicted to encode all the metabolic pathways typical of free-living chemoautotrophs, including carbon fixation, sulfur oxidation, nitrogen assimilation, and amino acid and cofactor/vitamin biosynthesis (fig. S1 and table S1). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. A circular representation of the R. magnifica genome. The innermost circle highlights genes of special interest: cbb (Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, red), sox (sulfur oxidation, green), dsr (dissimilatory sulfite reductase, blue), and rnf (NADH dehydrogenase). The second and third circles show GC skew and %G+C, respectively. The distribution of genes is depicted on the two outer rings (fourth and fifth, forward and reverse, respectively) colored by role category. The following sections outline the reconstruction of R. magnifica's chemoautotrophic metabolism and what this might mean for the biology of its host. Our analysis provides direct evidence that this symbiont fixes carbon via the Calvin cycle, the dominant form of carbon fixation in vent symbioses (5), by using energy derived from sulfur oxidation. The R. magnifica genome encodes enzymes specific to this cycle, including a form II ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO) and phosphoribulokinase (6). Interestingly, however, it appears that R. magnifica lacks homologs of sedoheptulose 1,7-bis phosphatase and fructose 1,6-bis-phosphatase and may regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate via an unconventional route, one that was a reversible pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase [supporting online material (SOM) text]. Energy for carbon fixation in R. magnifica appears to result from sulfur oxidation via the sox (sulfur oxidation) and dsr (dissimilatory sulfite reductase) genes (fig. S1). The symbiont may oxidize its sulfur granules via dsr homologs when external sulfide is lacking, as occurs in both Allochromatium vinosum and Chlorobium limicola (7, 8). Homologs encoding both a sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase and rhodanese are also present, and, with the dsr and sox proteins, these enzymes can oxidize sulfide or thiosulfate to sulfite (fig. S1). Sulfite can then be oxidized to sulfate by adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) reductase and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sulfurylase before being exported from the cell via a sulfate transporter. Genomic evidence of the Calvin cycle and the sulfur oxidation pathways confirms the chemoautoautotrophic nature of this symbiosis. These data support prior reports showing RuBisCO and ATP sulfurylase activity in C. magnifica gill tissue (4, 9), carbon dioxide uptake by the clam in response to sulfide or thiosulfate (10), and sulfide-binding, zinc-containing lipoprotein in the host blood stream (11). Energy conservation via the creation of a charge across a membrane proceeds in R. magnifica through a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase, a sulfide: quinone oxidoreductase, and an rnf complex (12). The genome encodes a straightforward electron transport chain; thus, the reduced quinone in the symbiont membrane may transfer electrons to cytochrome c via a bc1 complex, and a terminal cytochrome c oxidase could then transfer these electrons to oxygen (fig. S1). Our analysis shows that R. magnifica has the potential to produce 20 amino acids, 10 vitamins or cofactors, and all necessary biosynthetic intermediates, supporting an essential role of symbiont metabolism in the nutrition of this symbiosis. Two nitrogen assimilation pathways, essential to provisioning of amino acids in the symbiosis, occur in R. magnifica. Nitrate and ammonia, which enter the cell via a nitrate or nitrite transporter and two ammonium permeases, are reduced via nitrate and nitrite reductase and assimilated via glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase, respectively (fig. S1). Although nitrate is the dominant nitrogen form at vents (13), the symbiont may also assimilate ammonia via recycling of the host's amino acid waste. Unlike any other sequenced endosymbiont genome, R. magnifica encodes complete pathways for the biosynthesis of 20 amino acids, including 9 essential amino acids or their precursors (fig. S3). R. magnifica also has complete biosynthetic pathways for the majority of vitamins and cofactors (SOM text). The genome encodes a complete glycolytic pathway and the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway and, interestingly, also encodes a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle lacking -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The lack of this enzyme has been suggested to indicate obligate autotrophy in other bacteria (14). Carbon fixed via the Calvin cycle can enter the TCA cycle through phosphoenolpyruvate and here could follow biosynthetic routes either to fumarate or to -ketoglutarate. As with other intracellular species, genes not found in the R. magnifica genome reveal important details about the interaction between host and symbiont. Few substrate-specific transporters were found, suggesting that the symbionts are leaky or that the host actively digests symbiont cells. Indeed, Ruthia's closest known relatives, the bathymodiolid mussel symbionts, are digested intracellularly by their host (15). Although the vesicomyids and the bathymodiolids are distantly related, putative degradative stages of symbionts also are observed within C. magnifica bacteriocytes (fig. S2b). The symbiont is also lacking the key cell division protein ftsZ suggesting that, like Chlamydia spp., intracellular division may not proceed through usual pathways (SOM text). Intracellular endosymbionts often follow distinctive evolutionary routes, including genome reduction, skewed base compositions, and elevated mutation rates (16). Given the apparent defects in DNA repair in R. magnifica (SOM text) and the likely evolutionary forces pushing this genome toward degradation, it is particularly informative that Ruthia retains genes encoding a full suite of chemoautotrophic processes. Indeed, R. magnifica has the largest genome of any intracellular symbiont sequenced to date and may represent an early intermediate in the evolution toward a plastid-like chemoautotrophic organelle. The broad array of metabolic pathways revealed through sequencing of the R. magnifica genome confirms and extends prior knowledge of host nutritional dependency.
This article has a correction. Please see:Is corrected by - July 06, 2007 Abstract Pathogenic bacteria use the type III secretion system to deliver effector proteins into host cells to modulate the host signaling pathways. In this study, the Shigella type III effector OspF was shown to inactivate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38]. OspF irreversibly removed phosphate groups from the phosphothreonine but not from the phosphotyrosine residue in the activation loop of MAPKs. Mass spectrometry revealed a mass loss of 98 daltons in p-Erk2, due to the abstraction of the proton concomitant with cleavage of the C-OP bond in the phosphothreonine residue. This unexpected enzymatic activity, termed phosphothreonine lyase, appeared specific for MAPKs and was shared by other OspF family members. Gram-negative bacterial pathogens often use the type III secretion system (TTSS) to inject into host cells effector proteins (1) that interfere with host signal transduction pathways to promote pathogen infection. MAPK signaling plays an important role in activating host innate immune responses in both plants and animals and is a frequent target of pathogenic effectors (2-4). Identification of host targets of TTSS effectors and elucidation of their biochemical functions are critical in understanding the mechanism and the evolution of bacterial pathogenesis (3, 5, 6). The TTSS effector OspF is present in all the four known pathogenic species of Shigella (7-9), a causative agent of bacillary dysentery (10). OspF, together with SpvC and HopAI1, represents a family of TTSS effectors conserved in both plant and animal bacterial pathogens (11) (fig. S1). None of the OspF family effectors has an established biological or biochemical function. To define the biochemical function of OspF and the OspF family of effectors as well as to identify their potential in vivo targets, we examined effects of OspF on the host immune signaling pathways, including those of nuclear factor B(NFB) and MAPKs. Transient expression of OspF in human 293T cells efficiently blocked extracellular signal- regulated kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling, whereas it did not alter NFB activation (Fig. 1A). OspF abrogated phosphorylation of endogenous Erk1/2, JNK, and p38 kinases (Fig. 1, B and C). These results suggest that OspF harbors a specific activity of down-regulating multiple MAPKs but not NFB signaling when overexpressed in mammalian cells. To define the specific step(s) in the MAPK pathway blocked by OspF, we turned to the canonical Erk pathway that is activated by a phosphorylation cascade of Raf, MAPK kinase (MEK), and Erk kinases (12). OspF blocked Erk activation in 293T cells transfected with either RasV12, v-Raf (constitutive active Raf), or MEK1-ED (constitutive active MEK1) (Fig. 1D). Meanwhile, RasV12-induced MEK1 phosphorylation remained intact despite the disappearance of Erk1/2 phosphorylation in cells expressing OspF (Fig. 1E). Thus, inhibition of Erk phosphorylation by OspF is downstream of MEK1 along the classical Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk cascade. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

Error bars indicate standard deviation. (E) Phosphospecific immunoblotting of activation of MEK1 and Erk1/2 in the presence of OspF. Erk1/2 phosphorylation can be reconstituted in the cell-free extracts system by adding upstream signaling molecules (3). Addition of bacterially expressed and highly purified OspF (fig. S2A) in 293T cell extracts abolished both RasV12 and active B-Raf-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation, whereas MEK1 phosphorylation was not affected (Fig. 2A). This excludes the transcriptional regulation of MAPK pathway by OspF and also provides a system that recapitulates the inhibition of MAPK signaling by OspF in cells. To further test whether OspF directly targets the Raf-MEK1-Erk1/2 cascade biochemically, we reconstituted the phosphorylation cascade of B-Raf-MEK1-Erk2 by using purified kinases. Addition of OspF to this reaction largely abolished Erk2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, recombinant OspF could inhibit phosphorylation of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Erk2 by MEK1-ED (Fig. 2C), suggesting that OspF directly targets Erks or MEKs. Recombinant Erk2 fused to maltose binding protein (MBP-Erk2), but not MBP alone, effectively precipitated OspF (fig. S2A). Flag-OspF also coprecipitated with endogenous Erk1/2 but not MEK1 from 293T cells (fig. S2B). Thus, OspF targets Erk and attenuates its phosphorylation status.

(E) Removal of the phosphate groups from p-JNK and p-p38 by OspF in vitro. (F) Phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of Myc-Erk2 modified by OspF in 293T cells. Given the direct association between OspF and Erk2 and that the basal amount of phospho-Erk1/2 (p-Erk1/2) was diminished by OspF addition in the cell-free reconstitution assay (Fig. 2A), we reasoned that OspF could harbor a phosphatase activity to reverse Erk phosphorylation. When in vitro phosphorylated GST-Erk2, JNK, and p38 were incubated with recombinant OspF, dephosphorylation indeed occurred (Fig. 2, D and E). Furthermore, OspF selectively removed phosphate groups from the threonine but not from the tyrosine residue in the pT-X-pY (13) motif in p-Erk2 (Fig. 2, D and F). Thus, OspF harbors an in vitro enzymatic activity of specifically removing phosphate groups from the phosphothreonine in the pT-X-pY motif in MAPKs, including Erk1/2, JNK, and p38. OspF appears to function as a threonine-specific MAPK phosphatase. However, our analysis rules out the possibility of a classical protein phosphatase of OspF in nature [
Abstract The normal synovium forms a membrane at the edges of joints and provides lubrication and nutrients for the cartilage. In rheumatoid arthritis, the synovium is the site of inflammation, and it participates in an organized tissue response that damages cartilage and bone. We identified cadherin-11 as essential for the development of the synovium. Cadherin-11-deficient mice have a hypoplastic synovial lining, display a disorganized synovial reaction to inflammation, and are resistant to inflammatory arthritis. Cadherin-11 therapeutics prevent and reduce arthritis in mouse models. Thus, synovial cadherin-11 determines the behavior of synovial cells in their proinflammatory and destructive tissue response in inflammatory arthritis. Cadherin adhesion molecules are a family of integral membrane proteins that contain five immunoglobulin (Ig)-like extracellular (cadherin) domains rigidified as an extended chain by interdomain calcium binding [reviewed in (1, 2)]. Cadherins mediate cellular adhesion by binding a cadherin of the same type on an adjacent cell via interactions of the extracellular N-terminal first cadherin domains. During embryonic development, cadherins provide the basis for cell sorting, aggregation, and tissue morphogenesis (1-3). Postnatally, cadherins provide cell-to-cell adhesion within tissues, contributing to the maintenance of tissue integrity and architecture (3, 4). Knowing these activities of cadherin proteins, we hypothesized that a mesenchymal cadherin may function to provide cell adhesion to organize the synovial membrane. The synovium consists of a lining layer containing fibroblasts and macrophages that overlies a sublining layer of loose connective tissue. Using immunohistochemical staining, we found that the condensed lining layer of synoviocytes in healthy mice expresses cadherin-11 (Fig. 1, A and B). In a strain of mice that develops spontaneous autoimmune arthritis (K/BxN) (5, 6), marked cadherin-11 expression was seen on cells with fibroblast morphology in the synovial lining and in the synovial pannus, a pathological outgrowth of synovial tissue derived from fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) (Fig. 1, C and D). Particularly intense staining of cadherin-11 was also noted in FLS within the pannus adjacent to bone and cartilage. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1.

(J) Immunoprecipitation of cadherin-11 from cultured FLS. WT and cadherin-11-null FLS were surface biotinylated, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with isotype control Ig (IgG1) or anti-cadherin-11 (15F7 and 5B2H5). (K to M) FLS express cadherin-11 in adherens junctions. WT FLS were fixed and stained with anti-cadherin-11 (K) and anti--catenin (L) (11). The colocalization of cadherin-11 and -catenin [(M), merged image] at sites of cellular interface is in a pattern consistent with that of adherens junctions. Magnification, 1000*. (N) Cadherin-11 mediates homophilic adhesion in FLS. WT and cadherin-11-null FLS were allowed to adhere to substrate cadherin-11-Fc in a cell-to-substrate adhesion assay (10). The homophilic adhesion of WT FLS to cadherin-11-Fc is absent in cadherin-11-null FLS. Error bars indicate SEM. To define which synovial cellular lineages express cadherin-11, we used multicolor cytofluorometric staining of freshly disaggregated joint tissues, using a newly generated monoclonal antibody (mAb) to cadherin-11 (anti-cadherin-11) (fig. S1) and CD45 (anti-CD45) (a marker of bone marrow-derived cells). Consistent with its expression on the FLS lineage in humans (7), we observed that cadherin-11 identifies a synovial population distinct from that identified by CD45 (Fig. 1, E and F). These findings were confirmed biochemically by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) isolation of CD45 or cadherin-11-expressing subpopulations. Western blotting of these sorted cells demonstrated no detectable cadherin-11 expression on the CD45+ subpopulation (Fig. 1G). Previous studies have demonstrated that fibroblasts lining the synovium express CD55 (8). In our analyses, CD55 expression was seen on about half of cadherin-11+ cells in arthritic joints (fig. S2). Cadherin-11 expression on cultured FLS, with the use of cell surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitaton with anti-cadherin-11, revealed the anticipated protein species of molecular weight 110,000 from wild-type FLS but not from FLS derived from cadherin-11-deficient mice (Fig. 1, H to J) (9). In addition, because cadherins associate with cytoplasmic -catenin, we performed multicolor immunofluorescence microscopy and found colocalization of cadherin-11 with -catenin in adherens junctions, specifically at sites of cell-to-cell contact between FLS (Fig. 1, K to M). By means of a cell-to-substrate adhesion assay (10), the ability of FLS derived from either wild-type or cadherin-11-deficient mice was assessed for binding to recombinant cadherin-11-Fc. Wild-type FLS demonstrated robust adhesion to cadherin-11-Fc, whereas cadherin-11-deficient FLS failed to adhere (Fig. 1N and fig. S1). These studies demonstrate cadherin-11 expression in murine synovial fibroblasts, the localization of cadherin-11 to adherens junctions, and the role of cadherin-11 in homophilic adhesion by synovial fibroblasts. The functional contribution of cadherin-11 to synovial fibroblast organization in synovial tissues was next explored. When compared to wild-type synovium, cadherin-11-deficient synovium demonstrated marked hypoplasia of the synovial lining, with decreased synovial lining compaction and reduced membrane folds (Fig. 2, A to C). A primary function of FLS is the elaboration of extracellular matrix (ECM). Using Masson's trichrome stain to highlight ECM, we found that the dense ECM of the synovial lining, apparent in wild-type mice, was markedly attenuated in cadherin-11-null mice (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, we conclude that cadherin-11 is necessary for cellular organization, compaction, and matrix elaboration of the synovial lining in vivo.

These observations prompted us to examine cartilage and bone erosion in the inflammatory arthritis model in vivo. Indeed, synovial tissue attachment to, migration over, and invasion into cartilage were markedly diminished in cadherin-11-deficient mice. Wild-type synovial pannus caused full-thickness cartilage erosion, whereas cadherin-11-null synovial pannus stopped at the cartilage edge (Fig. 4, C and D, black arrowheads). Quantification by histomorphometric methods confirmed an 80% reduction in cartilage erosion in cadherin-11-deficient mice. By comparison, bone erosions, which are primarily dependent on osteoclast function (18-20), were evident to a similar degree in both wild-type and cadherin-11-null mice (Fig. 4E).

These studies suggest that, in healthy mice, cadherin-11 directs the establishment and maintenance of the normal synovial lining by conferring on FLS an ability to form cell-to-cell adhesion and compaction, as well as a capacity to produce ECM (Fig. 2). In the context of inflammatory arthritis, in which the synovium undergoes organized pathologic changes, mesenchymal lineage FLS contribute to these dramatic changes in the synovial lining (21-24). In cadherin-11-deficient mice, the synovial lining and synovial pannus tissue appeared architecturally aberrant and chaotic (Fig. 3, C and D), underscoring the role of cadherin-11 in fibroblast participation in the organized pathological synovial lining hyperplasia and pannus tissue destruction of cartilage in inflammatory arthritis. The data suggest that cadherin-11 influences both the degree of inflammation (Fig. 3, A and B and G and H) and the organized pathologic response of the synovial tissue in response to arthritogenic K/BxN serum transfer (Fig. 4, C and E). In rheumatoid arthritis, the FLS population demonstrates a metabolically active, secretory state (25). Stimulation of FLS can induce secretion of a number of proinflammatory mediators that have been postulated to amplify and perpetuate synovial inflammation. Our findings suggest that cadherin-11 influences FLS participation in the synovial inflammatory reaction, in addition to its role in tissue remodeling and cartilage invasion. These insights identify previously unappreciated mechanisms governing the behavior of the joint lining and reveal the central role of a synovial cadherin in determining the behavior of the resident synovial mesenchymal cells in the dynamic and orchestrated tissue response in inflammatory arthritis.
Abstract For many insects, the polarization pattern of the blue sky serves as a compass cue for spatial navigation. E-vector orientations are detected by photoreceptors in a dorsal rim area of the eye. Polarized-light signals from both eyes are finally integrated in the central complex, a brain area consisting of two subunits, the protocerebral bridge and the central body. Here we show that a topographic representation of zenithal E-vector orientations underlies the columnar organization of the protocerebral bridge in a locust. The maplike arrangement is highly suited to signal head orientation under the open sky. Many animals, including birds, fishes, cephalopods, and arthropods, share the ability to perceive linearly polarized light (1, 2). The plane of polarization (E-vector) varies systematically across the blue sky and depends on the Sun's position. For a variety of insects this pattern has been shown to guide spatial orientation (2). In locusts, polarotactic orientation depends on a specialized part of the compound eye, the dorsal rim area (3), and involves several central processing stages, including the central complex (4-7). The central complex (CC) is a group of neuropils spanning the midline of the insect brain. Substructures are the protocerebral bridge (PB) and the upper and lower divisions of the central body. An outstanding anatomical feature of the CC is its regular and highly sophisticated internal neuroarchitecture (8-10). In simplified terms, it consists of stacks of arrays, each composed of a linear arrangement of 16 columns with topographic interhemispheric connections between columns both within and between different arrays. Hypotheses on the functional roles of the CC range from a control center for motor coordination (11) to a recently demonstrated involvement in visual pattern learning and recognition (12). In the locust, several cell types of the CC are sensitive to the orientation of zenithal E-vectors (5), but the correspondence of cell morphology and E-vector tuning has remained obscure. In this study, we have used intracellular recordings combined with dye injections to analyze E-vector tuning in CC neurons of the locust with columnar arborization domains. Two major classes of polarization-sensitive (POL) neurons were encountered regularly when we recorded from CC neurons: (i) a particular type of tangential neuron of the PB and (ii) several types of columnar neurons. Tangential neurons of the PB, termed here TB1 neurons, have not been described previously in the locust or any other insect. A total number of 18 of these cells were analyzed. Their morphology was revealed by iontophoretic tracer injection, histological processing, and camera lucida reconstruction (13). TB1 neurons provide a connection between a posterior brain region, the posterior optic tubercle, and the PB (Fig. 1, A and B). Each TB1 neuron had two domains of varicose and, thus, putatively presynaptic arborizations confined to a single column in each hemisphere of the PB. When PB columns are numbered as L1 (lateralmost column in the left hemisphere of the PB) to L8 (most medial column in the left hemisphere) and, accordingly, from R1 to R8 in the right hemisphere of the bridge, TB1 neurons with varicose ramifications in columns R1/L8, R2/L7, R4/L5, R5/L4, R6/L3, and R7/L2 were encountered. Varicose processes were always eight columns apart, with processes ipsilaterally in one of the four outer columns and contralaterally in one of the four inner columns (Fig. 1E). The columns neighboring those with varicose processes were free of ramifications, and six to eight other columns were invaded with fine, smooth arborizations. Furthermore, all TB1 neurons had varicose arborizations in the posterior optic tubercle, a brain area connected to a small neuropil in the optic lobe, the accessory medulla (14).

Each line represents one TB1 neuron in the PB (black squares: columns with varicose arborizations; gray squares: columns with smooth arborizations; white squares: columns without arborizations). Asterisks indicate TB1 neurons shown in (A) and (B). (F) Correlation between location of varicose columns in the PB and E-vector tuning (max) of TB1 neurons (n = 18). Because each neuron has varicose arborizations in single columns in the right and left PB hemisphere, max values were plotted twice for the right hemisphere (open circles) and the left hemisphere (filled circles). Linear regression shows significant correlation (r = 0.81, SD = 35.8, P max) was determined for each neuron by circular statistics [Rayleigh test (15)]. E-vector tuning of TB1 neurons showed a linear relation to the position of their varicose ramifications in the PB (Fig. 1F). Thereby, a range of max tunings of 182 71 extends through the eight columns of each hemisphere of the PB and, thus, corresponds to the whole range of possibly occurring E-vector orientations. Because the E-vector map in the PB corresponds with the proposed output regions of the TB1 neurons, we asked whether candidate post-synaptic neurons show a similar representation of E-vector tuning. Columnar neurons have arborizations in single columns of the PB and send axonal projections to an area outside the CC, the lateral accessory lobe (LAL). Several cell types have additional arborizations in distinct columns of the central body. Three types of these neurons are polarization-sensitive (Fig. 2). We evaluated the data from 19 recordings from these cell types, termed CPU1, CP1, and CP2 neurons. CPU1 neurons have smooth endings in single columns of the PB, in columns of the dorsalmost layer I of the upper division of the central body (CBU), and an axonal fiber with varicose endings in the LAL (Fig. 2A). Each neuron connects a single column of the PB with two neighboring columns of the CBU, following a wiring scheme described for Drosophila (9) (Fig. 2G). All CPU1 neurons (10 recordings) showed polarization opponency and background spiking activity of 20 to 40 Hz. Comparison of the innervated columns in the PB and max tuning again revealed a spatial representation of E-vector orientations across the PB, which covered a range of 228 73 through the 8 PB columns in one brain hemisphere (Fig. 2I). The slope of the regression lines of TB1 and CPU1 neurons did not differ significantly [P = 0.32, analysis of covariance (16)], indicating that the tuning range through the 16 columns of the bridge matched for both cell types. However, the CPU1 map was shifted by 101 (equivalent to -79) relativetothe mapof TB1 neurons (significantly different elevation of regression lines, P 1/2m.

(J) CP1 neurons (open circles) and CP2 neurons (filled circles) have been combined for statistical analysis (r = 0.97, SD = 38.0, P . Confidence bands are shown at 95%. CBL, CBU, lower and upper divisions of the central body; LAL, lateral accessory lobe; LT, lateral triangle; MO, median olive; PB, protocerebral bridge. The remaining two types of columnar neurons, CP1 and CP2 neurons, also connected the PB with the LAL (Fig. 2, B, C, and H), but lacked arborizations in the central body. Within the LAL, projections were confined to either of two subcompartments, the median olive (CP1) or the lateral triangle (CP2). Both types of neuron had smooth arborizations in the PB and varicose endings in the LAL. In all recordings (n = 9), CP1 and CP2 neurons showed polarization opponency, but had lower background activity (3 to 15 Hz) than CPU1 and TB1 neurons. As for CPU1 and TB1 neurons, regression analysis of pooled data from CP1 and CP2 neurons revealed a linear correlation between the innervated column in the PB and the E-vector tuning of the neurons (Fig. 2J). The linear regression for CP1 and CP2 covered a range of 206 76 over one hemisphere (eight columns) of the PB and was not significantly different from the linear regression for CPU1 neurons (slope: P = 0.4777, elevation: P = 0.3525). It was, however, phase-shifted by 111 (equivalent to -69) against the map of TB1 neurons. The present study shows, independently for three different cell types, that a map of zenithal E-vector orientations underlies the columnar organization of the locust PB. This spatial representation adds a level of complexity to sensory processing in the insect brain, hitherto thought to be achieved only in vertebrates. In most neurons at least half-maximal activation occurred over an E-vector orientation range of about 60, implying considerable overlap for neighboring columns and the necessity of a population code for retrieving exact information from the firing rates of these cells (17). Under the open sky, the activity in the POL neurons described here is directly related to the directional orientation of the locust's head, provided that additional mechanisms (color coding, intensity coding) allow the animal to distinguish the solar from the antisolar hemisphere of the sky. Color-coding properties suited to fulfill this requirement have been demonstrated recently for POL neurons at an input stage to the CC, the anterior optic tubercle (18). Neurons encoding head direction have been intensely studied in mammals (19, 20). An important difference of the locust polarization analyzers in the CC is their global nature of signaling. The neurons fire according to zenithal E-vectors, which provide information about the Sun's azimuth and, therefore, these neurons behave like an internal 180 compass. In rats, in contrast, head-direction cells are recalibrated to visual landmarks in each new environment and are apparently not arranged topographically (21, 22). Although some progress has been made in analyzing the wiring principles from which computational maps arise in vertebrates (23, 24), the simple brains of locusts offer the opportunity to address this question at the level of single identified neurons. Within the PB, the spatial maps of tangential and columnar neurons are out of phase by about 90. If TB1 neurons are directly connected to the columnar neurons, a phase shift of 90 might most easily result from inhibitory connections of TB1 neurons to the dendritic trees of columnar neurons. Double-labeling experiments showed that serotonin and a Dipallatostatin-related neuropeptide are present in TB1 neurons (fig. S5). For both substances, inhibitory effects have been demonstrated in other systems (25, 26). Whereas azimuthal space is linearly represented in the columns of the PB, the wiring of CPU1 neurons should result in a superposition of the two 180 representations of the PB in the CBU, but with a lateral shift of about 50 (fig. S3). The functional consequences of this shift are presently unknown. If the E-vector tunings of corresponding CPU1 neurons in each of the eight double columns of the CBU are merged, the azimuth representation would be reduced to only about 156 of frontal space. On the basis of the data presented here and a recent paper by Liu et al. (12), a coherent functional role for the CC is emerging. In Drosophila, tangential neurons innervating specific layers of the central body are essential for recognizing features of visual objects (elevation in the panorama; contour orientation). Columnar neurons, like the CPU1 neurons, are ideal candidates to associate these visual features with information on their azimuthal direction (fig. S4). Liu et al. (12) already hypothesized that the width of the CBU represents azimuthal space. This is strongly supported by our data, but this representation may differ between cell types and CC substructures as pointed out above.

Abstract Plant immune responses are triggered by pattern recognition receptors that detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or by resistance (R) proteins recognizing isolate-specific pathogen effectors. We show that in barley, intracellular mildew A (MLA) R proteins function in the nucleus to confer resistance against the powdery mildew fungus. Recognition of the fungal avirulence A10 effector by MLA10 induces nuclear associations between receptor and WRKY transcription factors. The identified WRKY proteins act as repressors of PAMP-triggered basal defense. MLA appears to interfere with the WRKY repressor function, thereby de-repressing PAMP-triggered basal defense. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which these polymorphic immune receptors integrate distinct pathogen signals. Plants have evolved two classes of immune receptors, each of which recognizes non-self molecular structures. One class involves membrane-resident pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as bacterial flagellin or chitin, a component of fungal cell walls (1). During interactions with virulent parasites, PRRs confer weak immune responses that attenuate pathogen growth and contribute to basal defense (1). Reduced PAMP-mediated defense probably results from successful host defense suppression by pathogen effectors (1). Resistance (R) proteins represent a second, mainly intracellular, immune receptor class having the capacity to directly or indirectly detect isolate-specific pathogen effectors, encoded by avirulence (AVR) genes (1). PRR-triggered immune responses are tightly linked to mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the activation of defense-related genes involving WRKY transcription factors (TFs) (2). Immediate signaling components of effector-activated R proteins are unknown. However, R protein-triggered immune responses are also linked to ROS accumulation and defense-gene activation but differ quantitatively and kinetically from basal defense, often leading to host cell suicide at invasion sites (3). This points to a convergence of PRR- and R protein-triggered signaling, but the nodes and mechanisms enabling plants to integrate signals from these two receptor classes remain elusive. The polymorphic barley mildew A (MLA) R locus encodes allelic receptors containing an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) structure, a central nucleotide-binding (NB) site, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region. MLA receptors share >90% sequence identity but recognize isolate-specific Blumeria graminis fsp. hordei effectors (4-7). MLA1/MLA6 hybrid analyses revealed that recognition specificity is determined by different but overlapping LRRs and a C-terminal non-LRR region (CT) (6). MLA steady-state levels are critical for effective resistance and are subject to control by cytosolic heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and the co-chaperone-like proteins RAR1 and SGT1 (8, 9). Recently, the B. graminis effector AVRA10, which is recognized by MLA10, was isolated and shown to belong to a diversified gene family comprising more than 30 paralogs (5, 10). The availability of the cognate MLA10 and AVRA10 gene pair, as well as the cell-autonomous nature of MLA resistance to B. graminis upon transient gene expression in single epidermal cells, enabled us to elucidate effector-dependent receptor functions (5, 7, 10). Nuclear activity of MLA receptors. Biochemical fractionation of leaf protein extracts from transgenic barley lines expressing epitope-tagged MLA1 or MLA6 detected the majority of the receptor in the soluble fraction (8). To examine the subcellular distribution of MLA, we biolistically delivered a DNA plasmid encoding MLA10 tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) into leaf epidermal cells and recorded YFP fluorescence by confocal imaging (Fig. 1A, upper panel). MLA10-YFP localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Biolistic delivery of wild-type MLA10 or MLA10-YFP constructs into single epidermal cells comparably restricted B. graminis growth in an AVRA10-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), demonstrating activity of the MLA10-YFP fusion protein. To determine the functional role of the nuclear MLA10 pool, we fused a nuclear export signal (NES) to the C terminus of MLA10-YFP (11). Expression of the MLA10-YFP-NES construct revealed undetectable nuclear fluorescence signals in the majority (>80%) of epidermal cells despite clearly visible cytoplasmic YFP fluorescence. In the remaining cells, nuclei were indirectly marked by a YFP halo (Fig. 1A, middle panel). If this difference in the subcellular distribution between MLA10-YFP-NES- and MLA10-YFP-expressing cells were due to a functional NES, then amino acid substitutions predicted to render the NES nonfunctional (nes) (11) should restore nuclear accumulation of a corresponding MLA10-YFP-nes fusion protein. Indeed, the subcellular YFP fluorescence distribution patterns of cells expressing MLA10-YFP-nes or MLA10-YFP were indistinguishable (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Inoculation with B. graminis expressing AVRA10 showed that the MLA10-YFP-NES receptor variant was inactive, whereas MLA10-YFP-nes restored activity to MLA10 wild-type-like levels (Fig. 1B). Together these data strongly imply that the nuclear pool of MLA10 is essential for its disease-resistance function. This is unexpected because MLA lacks known nuclear localization signals.

Data were obtained from three independent experiments. (C) Western blot of MLA1-HA in nuclear and soluble fractions of healthy or B. graminis-challenged leaves. Purified nuclear and nuclei-depleted soluble fractions were prepared from leaves of a transgenic line expressing MLA1-HA (8) at the indicated time points [hours post inoculation (hpi)] after inoculation with B. graminis isolates expressing or lacking AVRA1 (incompatible or compatible). All fractions were subjected to immunoblot analyses. This loading represents an approximately 16-fold overrepresentation of nuclear proteins on a per-tissue amount basis. O, non-inoculated controls. Histone H3, cytosolic Hsp90, and Coomassie blue (CB) staining of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RubisCO) were used as fraction markers. We next analyzed stable transgenic barley lines containing a single copy of functional epitope-tagged MLA1 driven by native 5' regulatory sequences (8). We purified nuclei from leaves of 7-day-old seedlings before and after inoculation with B. graminis isolates expressing or lacking the cognate AVRA1 effector. Immunoblot analyses detected MLA1-HA in both nuclear extracts and nuclei-depleted soluble fractions (Fig. 1C). A time-course experiment revealed an apparent increase of the nuclear MLA1-HA pool in the incompatible interaction (12, 18, and 24 hours after spore inoculation) as compared to the compatible interaction (Fig. 1C; similar results were obtained with protein extracts from leaf epidermal tissue). This demonstrates the existence of a nuclear pool for a second MLA receptor, is indicative of dynamic changes of the nuclear pool during the immune response, and suggests that the intracellular distribution of MLA10-YFP observed in the single-cell system probably reflects its physiological locations. HvWRKY1/2 TFs interact with the MLA CC domain. We constructed yeast two-hybrid baits encoding single or multiple domains of MLA1 or MLA6 CC-NB-LRR-CT receptors and screened a barley prey cDNA library derived from healthy and B. graminis-challenged leaf epidermal tissue (Fig. 2A) (8, 12). The bait MLA CC1-46 (an invariant sequence in all known MLA receptors) identified four interactors. Two were dismissed because of their predicted localization in chloroplasts and mitochondria. One identified prey cDNA encoded an N-terminally truncated version of a WRKY domain-containing TF, designated HvWRKY2 (Hv, Hordeum vulgare) (Fig. 2A; GenBank accession number AJ853838). A highly sequence-related homolog, designated HvWRKY1 (GenBank accession number AJ536667), sharing 72% sequence similarity and identical domains and motifs (fig. S2), was subsequently isolated and also found to interact with the MLA CC1-46 bait by targeted yeast two-hybrid experiments. To characterize MLA and HvWRKY1/2 TFs interactions, we performed directed yeast two-hybrid assays using truncated and full-length receptor and TF variants. Although interactions were found with truncated forms of the receptor and the TFs (Fig. 2A), the full-length MLA6 bait failed to interact with all tested HvWRKY1 or HvWRKY2 prey variants despite the presence of comparable amounts of the LexA-MLA fusion proteins (fig. S1). This might indicate requirements for intra- and intermolecular interactions in vivo. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

GST or GST-HvWRKY2107-319 were incubated with HA epitope-tagged MLA1 CC1-166 before GST pull-downs. Ten 1/2l of the mixtures was subjected to immunoblot analysis with antiserum to HA as an input control. MLA1 CC1-166 was detected by antiserum to HA, GST-WRKY2107-319, and GST by Ponceau staining. To examine whether MLA directly interacts with HvWRKY1/2, we performed in vitro pull-down assays. A hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged MLA1 CC1-166 fragment was expressed in a wheat germ in vitro translation system and subsequently incubated with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HvWRKY2107-319 or GST alone purified from Escherichia coli lysates. Immunoblot analysis of GST pull-down precipitates with HA antibodies revealed the presence of MLA1 CC1-166 in GST-HvWRKY2107-319 but not GST precipitates (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with a physical interaction between the MLA1 CC and the HvWRKY2 TF. HvWRKY1/2 repressor functions. To elucidate the functional role of HvWRKY1 and HvWRKY2 in immune responses to B. graminis, we first examined their contribution to basal defense mechanisms by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) during a compatible interaction. Barley seedlings were inoculated with a barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) vector harboring antisense fragments of HvWRKY1 (BSMV-WRKY1as) or HvWRKY2 (BSMV-WRKY2as) or control vectors (Fig. 3A) (13). Two weeks after BSMV infection, leaves were inoculated with a virulent B. graminis isolate, and the frequency of fungal microcolonies on the leaf surface was microscopically scored 48 hours later. Whereas leaves inoculated with the control vectors supported a frequency of 15 2% and 19 2% microcolonies, respectively, significantly reduced levels were found with BSMV-WRKY1as and BSMV-WRKY2as [7 2% and 9 3% (Fig. 3A); the fourth leaf was used for VIGS experiments that show a higher level of basal defense than did the first true leaf used for single-cell gene expression studies]. This is consistent with and extends previous data showing heightened resistance to a different virulent B. graminis isolate upon HvWRKY1 single-cell silencing in the leaf epidermis (14), suggesting that HvWRKY1 and HvWRKY2 act as repressors of basal defense to virulent B. graminis.

(A) B. graminis microcolony formation on barley leaves after BSMV-mediated HvWRKY1 or HvWRKY2 silencing. BSMV empty vector (BSMV-EV) and BSMV-TaLr10as were used as controls. BSMV-TaLr10as harbors an antisense fragment of the 3' untranslated region of wheat TaLr10 that is of similar length to BSMV-WRKY1as or BSMV-WRKY2as. Mean values of microcolony formation are based on the microscopic analysis of at least 600 interaction sites at 48 hours after inoculation with B. graminis conidiospores of virulent isolate A6. Asterisk indicates significant difference at P 20 fold), rapidly (within 3 hours), and transiently activated upon B. graminis challenge in both compatible and MLA-specified incompatible interactions (fig. S3A) approximately 10 hours before differential infection phenotypes became microscopically visible. This, and the observation that a similarly strong and even faster HvWRKY1 and HvWRKY2 activation occurred upon treatment of leaves with the bacterial flg22 PAMP (fig. S3B), support our hypothesis that both genes are components of PAMP-triggered basal defense. Next we investigated the importance of the physical association between the invariant MLA CC domain and HvWRKY1/2 during incompatible interactions. We reasoned that if MLA receptors function through interference with HvWRKY1/2 repressor activity in basal defense, then single-cell overexpression of HvWRKY1/2 might block MLA function because of inappropriate timing and/or TF levels. Indeed, single-cell HvWRKY2 overexpression fully compromised tested MLA1-HA-, MLA10-, and MLA12-specified immune responses to B. graminis isolates expressing cognate AvrA effectors (Fig. 3C; similar results were obtained with HvWRKY1). We previously showed that MLA12 single-cell overexpression alters the resistance kinetics, but not specificity, so that the growth of a larger proportion of fungal germlings is terminated earlier in comparison to MLA12 wild-type plants (6). To test whether overexpression of the receptor can negate the effect of overexpressed HvWRKY2, we co-delivered HvWRKY2 with MLA10 or MLA12. This still compromised both MLA-specified immune responses (Fig. 3C), indicating that in wild-type plants HvWRKY2 expression must be tightly controlled to ensure proper MLA function. SUSIBA2 WRKY overexpression did not interfere with tested MLA1-HA-triggered immunity, again illustrating that only particular WRKY TFs can interfere with immune responses to B. graminis (Fig. 3C). HvWRKY2 overexpression also failed to compromise MLG-triggered race-specific as well as mlo-mediated race-nonspecific resistance to B. graminis (Fig. 3C) (17, 18). This is consistent with previous results demonstrating separate genetic pathways for race-specific and mlo-mediated resistance (19) and revealing the existence of at least one HvWRKY2 independent R gene-triggered immune response to B. graminis. Effector-dependent association between MLA and HvWRKY2. To directly test associations between the MLA receptor and HvWRKY2 in plants, we labeled the proteins with the yellow (YFP)- or blue [cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)]-shifted variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), respectively. Upon biolistic delivery of the corresponding DNA plasmids into epidermal cells, functional MLA10-YFP and functional CFP-HvWRKY2 fusion proteins colocalized in epidermal nuclei (fig. S4, A and B; CFP-HvWRKY2 exclusively localizes to the nucleus in all experiments described below). To test protein associations in the presence or absence of the cognate AVRA10 pathogen effector (10), we monitored for Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the fluorescence tags of MLA10-YFP and CFP-HvWRKY2. In this study, we adopted a quantitative noninvasive fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) approach to detect FRET (fig. S5). To calculate FRET efficiency (E) the lifetime of the donor in the presence of the acceptor (DA) only needs to be compared with its lifetime in the absence of the acceptor (D): E = 1 - DA/D. This approach has the advantage that FRET and control measurements can be performed in different cells because fluorescence lifetimes are independent of the actual fluorophore concentration. We measured the lifetimes of free CFP and CFP fusion proteins as a control. The average lifetime of free CFP was 2.53 0.02 ns (mean SEM, n = 8 nuclei) (fig. S6F). Unexpectedly, the average CFP lifetime in nuclei expressing the CFP-HvWRKY2 fusion was reduced to 2.12 0.02 ns (n = 24; Fig. 4A and fig. S6F), indicating possible homo-FRET between the CFP tags of associated CFP-HvWRKY2 fusion proteins (20). In contrast, the average CFP lifetime of CFP-SUSIBA2 (2.47 0.01 ns, n = 5; fig. S6, C and F) was close to that of unfused CFP (2.53 0.02). To directly test for HvWRKY2 dimerization, we generated a YFP-HvWRKY2 construct and co-delivered it with CFP-HvWRKY2 into epidermal cells. A dramatic reduction of the average CFP lifetime to 1.29 0.04 ns (n = 7) was recorded in nuclei coexpressing the fusion proteins (fig. S6, A and F). To rule out the possibility that CFP lifetime reduction was due to unspecific associations between the fluorescent tags, we coexpressed as a control CFP-HvWRKY2 and unfused YFP. Nuclei coexpressing these two proteins showed an average CFP lifetime of 2.03 0.01 ns (n = 12; fig. S6, B and F), which is close to the average CFP lifetime of CFP-WRKY2 alone (2.12 0.02 ns). Collectively, this provides strong in vivo evidence for homomeric HvWRKY2 associations. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 4.

(Right column) Histogram of mean CFP fluorescence lifetimes obtained for all measured nuclei expressing the indicated protein(s). Bar heights represent the number of nuclei whose mean lifetime falls within the indicated 0.1-ns range. In the coexpression experiments, a measured lifetime was considered to be significantly (P 0.03 ns, n = 12; Fig. 4B and fig. S6F) and found that it did not differ significantly (P 0.01 ns). Thus, there is no evidence for constitutive associations between the immune receptor and the TF, which is consistent with undetectable interactions between full-length MLA and HvWRKY1/2 in the yeast two-hybrid experiments (Fig. 2). However, cells subjected to cotransformation of CFP-HvWRKY2, MLA10-YFP, and the B. graminis AVRA10 effector, which is recognized by MLA10, produced a broad CFP lifetime distribution not seen in any other tested combinations, ranging from 1.32 to 2.17 ns (Fig. 4C and fig. S6F). Ten out of 27 (37%) CFP lifetime measurements yielded lifetimes that were significantly shorter than that of the CFP-HvWRKY2 control (Fig. 4A), indicating AVRA10-stimulated associations between MLA10 and HvWRKY2. That a portion of the measured CFP lifetimes does not differ from the control measurements could indicate that the stoichiometry between the three proteins and putative auxiliary factors is critical and/or that the association between receptor and WRKY TF is only transient by nature. When we coexpressed CFP-HvWRKY2, MLA10-YFP, and the B. graminis effector AVRK1 [an AVRA10 homolog recognized by the MLK R protein (10)], the average CFP lifetime (2.06 0.03 ns, n = 14) did not differ significantly from the lifetime found in nuclei coexpressing CFP-HvWRKY2 and MLA10-YFP (Fig. 4D and fig. S6F). Furthermore, replacement of CFP-HvWRKY2 by CFP-SUSIBA2 in combinations with MLA10-YFP and AVRA10 or AVRK1 failed to generate a pronounced broadening of the CFP lifetime distribution [lifetimes were 2.42 0.03 ns (n = 11) and 2.43 0.02 ns (n = 11), respectively; fig. S6, D to F]. Together, this corroborates the ability of MLA immune receptors to interact with particular WRKY family members in the nucleus and supports the notion of an AVRA10-dependent physical association between MLA10 and HvWRKY2. The FLIM-FRET data were substantiated by using the conventional acceptor photobleaching method (APB-FRET). To estimate the extent of FRET, the donor fluorescence intensity is measured before and after the acceptor chromophore is bleached. Donor fluorescence intensity increases in those cases where FRET has occurred before bleaching. Such an increase in CFP intensity was observed only in nuclei coexpressing CFP-HvWRKY2, MLA10-YFP, and AVRA10 (fig. S7) but not in nuclei coexpressing CFP-HvWRKY2 and YFP, or CFP-HvWRKY2, MLA10-YFP, and AVRK1 (fig. S7). This independently confirms the AVRA10-dependent physical association between MLA10 and HvWRKY2 in nuclei. AtWRKY18/40 repressor functions. WRKY TFs belong to large gene families in Arabidopsis and in rice (21, 22). Arabidopsis AtWRKY18, AtWRKY40, and AtWRKY60 (At, Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice OsWRKY28 and OsWRKY71 (Os, Oryza sativa) show the highest sequence relatedness to HvWRKY1 and HvWRKY2 (fig. S2). The deduced proteins form a distinct subgroup of group II WRKYs containing a leucine zipper (LZ) domain thought to be involved in homo- and/or heterocomplex formation (23, 24). AtWRKY18, AtWRKY40, and AtWRKY60 have been recently implicated in repressing basal defense to virulent hemibiotrophic Pseudomonas syringae (24). We tested mutant lines of these Arabidopsis WRKY family members by inoculation with the virulent powdery mildew Golovinomyces orontii (24) (and our collections). Although single Atwrky18, Atwrky40, or Atwrky60 mutant plants and Atwrky18/60 or Atwrky40/60 double mutants retained Col-0 wild-type-like susceptibility, the Atwrky18/40 and Atwrky18/40/60 triple mutant lines were almost fully resistant (Fig. 5, A and B). This reveals redundant AtWRKY18 and AtWRKY40 activities and points to a conserved repressor function of the dicot and monocot homologs in basal defense.

(A) Infection phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants 10 days after inoculation with virulent G. orontii. Plant genotypes are indicated. (B) Macroscopic leaf infection phenotype of a representative Col-0 and Atwrky18/40 plant shown in (A). Although Atwrky18/40 double mutants do not constitutively express defense-associated genes (24), genome-wide gene expression profiling experiments upon inoculation with virulent P. syringae DC3000 revealed that a subset of 23 genes accumulates earlier and is 3.5-fold or more up-regulated in the Atwrky18/40 double mutant but not in Atwrky18 or Atwrky40 single mutants (table S1). This subset contains 21 PAMP-responsive genes, including the 6-fold up-regulated SID2, which encodes isochorismate synthase 1, required for salicylic acid biosynthesis, and is a major contributor to basal defense against G. orontii (25, 26). Thus, mutants lacking the AtWRKY18/40 repressors retain the ability to execute stimulus-dependent defense-gene expression and the response appears to be exaggerated. These findings imply the existence of an AtWRKY18/40-dependent feedback repression system as an intrinsic control feature of basal defense. Conclusions. Few host factors have been identified that directly interact with intracellular NB-LRR proteins and participate in receptor function. A subset of these, including cytosolic Hsp90, determines R protein steady-state levels, possibly by regulated folding of monomeric R proteins and/or preactivated R protein-containing complexes (27). Arabidopsis RIN4 interacts with the NB-LRR type R proteins RPM1 and RPS2, forming a preactivation receptor complex at the plasma membrane that permits indirect recognition of the cognate P. syringae effectors AvrRpm1 and AvrRpt2, respectively (28, 29). Whether AVRA10 is directly or indirectly recognized by the cytoplasmic and/or nuclear MLA10 pool remains unknown. However, unrestricted growth of AVRA10-expressing B. graminis after coexpression of MLA10 and HvWRKY2 (Fig. 3C) is difficult to reconcile with a scenario in which the TF serves as the effector target that indirectly activates the receptor. We could not detect association of the functional, fluorochrome-tagged MLA10 and HvWRKY2 by FRET-FLIM in the absence of AVRA10. This suggests that the specific, AVRA10-stimulated nuclear association between receptor and TF is a postrecognition event involving activated MLA. Altered intramolecular interactions in the NB-LRR R proteins Rx and Bs2 probably accompany their effector-dependent activation (30, 31). Because MLA recognition specificity is determined by the sequence-divergent LRR-CT region (6), direct or indirect effector-induced modulations of the MLA LRR-CT may similarly lead to intramolecular interaction changes, in turn permitting an association of the invariant CC domain with HvWRKY1/2. Our data suggest that the transcriptional machinery of PAMP-triggered basal defense is a direct target of MLA, thereby providing a link between PRR- and R protein-triggered immunity. Although transcriptional reprogramming of the host during incompatible versus compatible interactions differs only quantitatively and kinetically (3), it is difficult to determine whether the typically weaker and/or less sustained defense-related gene expression during compatible interactions is the consequence of effector-mediated defense suppression or is an intrinsic feature of PAMP-triggered basal defense. The retained pathogen-dependent but exaggerated activation of a subset of defense-related genes in Arabidopsis Atwrky18 wrky40 double mutants is consistent with the existence of at least one negative feedback system operating in PAMP-mediated basal defense. Because enhanced defense against virulent G. orontii in Atwrky18/40 plants was accompanied by extensive leaf cell death (Fig. 5), AtWRKY18/40-dependent repression might restrict the output of PAMP-triggered basal defense below a detrimental threshold and, at the same time, function as a hair trigger of the primed immune system for R protein-dependent defense potentiation driving host cells into suicide. Given that AtWRKY18/40 are functionally homologous to HvWRKY1/2, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the observed genetic interference (Fig. 3C) and physical association (Figs. 2 and 4) between MLA and HvWRKY1/2 during incompatible interactions with B. graminis result in derepression of PAMP-triggered basal defense (fig. S8). This regulatory logic of MLA function could explain why, after biolistic delivery of AVRA10 into host epidermal cells of MLA10 genotypes (that is, in the absence of PAMPs), most cells remain alive (10). Direct targeting of PAMP-activated HvWRKY1/2 repressors by MLA receptors also implies a short signaling pathway that may not require genuine R gene-specific signaling components. Plant and animal innate immune systems are thought to have evolved independently from each other (32). Accordingly, biochemical constraints might have contributed to the engagement of structurally related components for immune functions in both phyla, including the CATERPILLER superfamily, which encompasses plant NB-LRR R and mammalian NOD proteins (33, 34). CATERPILLER proteins have either demonstrated or anticipated roles as microbial component sensors to control immune and inflammatory responses. In this context, direct targeting of HvWRKY1/2 repressors by MLA R proteins in the nucleus is reminiscent of the nuclear CATERPILLER CIITA function, which acts through direct association with DNA binding proteins to regulate the expression of all major histocompatibility complex class II and other genes important in antigen presentation (34). Domain fusion events between a WRKY and NB-LRR domain in two Arabidopsis proteins, including the RRS1-R R protein-to-Ralstonia solanacearum infection (35), suggest similar transcription machinery-associated functions of plant immune receptors.
Abstract Supernova 1987A, the first naked-eye supernova observed since Kepler's supernova in 1604, defies a number of theoretical expectations. Its anomalies have long been attributed to a merger between two massive stars that occurred some 20,000 years before the explosion, but so far there has been no conclusive proof that this merger took place. Here, we present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the mass ejection associated with such a merger and the subsequent evolution of the ejecta, and we show that this accurately reproduces the properties of the triple-ring nebula surrounding the supernova. Supernova 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud was one of the major astronomical events of the 1980s, but it was highly unusual. The progenitor star, Sk -69202, was one of the surprises. Massive stars similar to the progenitor of SN 1987A are expected to end their evolution as red supergiants, but Sk -69202 was a blue supergiant. Moreover, the outer layers of the star were highly enriched in helium (1), suggesting that some nuclear processed material from the core had been mixed into the envelope by a nonstandard mixing process (2). Most notably, the supernova was surrounded by a complex triple-ring nebula (3, 4) consisting of material that was ejected from the progenitor some 20,000 years before the explosion in an almost axi-symmetric but very nonspherical manner. Together, this evidence indicates that a dramatic event affected the progenitor some 20,000 years before the explosion, most likely the merger of two massive stars (5). A merger was first suggested to explain some of the asymmetries of the supernova ejecta (6). Later it was realized that a binary merger would also explain the blue progenitor and its main chemical anomalies (7-9). This hypothesis has since been confirmed by detailed stellar, hydrodynamical simulations of the slow merger of two massive stars (10). However, the origin of the triple-ring nebula has so far not found a satisfactory explanation. The triple-ring nebula consists of three overlapping rings in projection. The supernova occurred at the center of the inner ring, and the outer rings are in planes almost parallel to the central ring plane but displaced by 0.4 pc above and below the central ring plane. Notably, these outer rings do not form the limb-brightened projection of an hourglass nebula, as in some of the early models for the nebula (11-13), but form instead dense, ringlike density enhancements (4). Previous attempts to model the nebula have involved interacting winds in a binary (14, 15), a photoionization-driven instability (16), mass ejection during a binary merger (17), or magnetically controlled ejection (18), but none of these has been able to fully explain both the detailed geometry and the kinematical properties of the nebula. The axi-symmetric but very nonspherical structure immediately suggests that rotation may have played a role in the formation. However, simple angular-momentum conservation arguments show that any single star that is rotating rapidly in its early evolution could rotate slowly only after it has expanded by a factor of 1/2100 to red-supergiant dimensions. On the other hand, a binary merger provides a simple and effective means of converting orbital angular momentum into spin angular momentum and of producing a single, rapidly rotating supergiant. A typical binary merger model for SN 1987A (9) assumes that the system initially consisted of two massive stars with masses of 1/215 and 1/25 solar masses (M) in a fairly wide orbit with an orbital period longer than 1/210 years. Given these parameters, the more massive component started to transfer mass to its companion only after it had completed helium burning in the core. Because of the large mass ratio, mass transfer was unstable, leading to a common envelope phase during which the secondary star was engulfed within the primary star's envelope (Fig. 1). In this phase, most of the orbital angular momentum of the binary was deposited in the common envelope, spinning the envelope up in the process. The friction with the envelope caused the secondary star's orbit to decay (i.e., to spiral in) inside the common envelope. Because the density increased inward, the spiral-in process accelerated until enough orbital energy had been released and deposited in the envelope to affect the envelope dynamically. The time scale of this energy ejection is comparable to the dynamical time scale of the envelope, meaning that the energy injection into the envelope was essentially impulsive; this led to a dynamical expansion of the envelope and substantial mass ejection. After the envelope expanded, the spiral in of the secondary star slowed down and occurred in a self-regulated manner, in which all of the orbital energy released was transported to the surface, where it was radiated away. Ultimately, the secondary star inside the envelope merged with the core, and in doing so dredged up core material from the primary star core (10). The whole merger process is expected to have taken a few hundred years. Afterward, the star was initially an oversized red supergiant, but it shrank over the course of a few thousand years-the time scale on which the envelope lost its excess thermal energy-and became a blue supergiant. In this phase, the fast, energetic wind from the blue supergiant swept up the ejecta associated with the merger and shaped the whole nebula.

The system initially consisted of a binary with two stars of 1/215 and 1/25 M with an orbital period longer than 1/210 years.

(C) The release of orbital energy due to the spiral in of the companion leads to the partial ejection of the envelope. (D) After the merging has been completed, the merged object evolves to become a blue supergiant, shedding its excess angular momentum in an equatorial outflow. In the final blue-supergiant phase, the energetic wind from the blue supergiant sweeps up all of the previous structures, producing the triple-ring nebula. To simulate the mass ejection during the merger and the subsequent evolution of the ejecta (Fig. 2), we used GADGET (19), a three-dimensional, particle-based hydrodynamics code that uses the smooth-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We split the simulations into two parts. First, we simulated the mass ejection associated with the merger, and then we took the output from this model to start a second calculation to simulate the subsequent evolution of the ejecta as they are being swept up by the blue-supergiant wind.

The star indicates the location of the supernova. Simulations are available online (movies S1 and S2). We modeled the red supergiant as a poly-trope with a central point source of 8 M, representing the compact core of the star and the immersed companion, and an envelope mass of 12 M; the initial radius of the star was taken to be 1500 R. We then mimicked the initial spin-up phase by adding angular momentum to the envelope over a period of 1/26 years until all of the angular momentum from the initial binary was deposited in the envelope (20). Because of this spin-up, the envelope became highly nonspherical and took on a disklike shape (Fig. 2A). Most of the orbital energy was injected impulsively when the orbital energy released was comparable to the binding energy of the envelope (21). This produced an inner region of overpressure that started to expand and drive a shock in the overlying layers, ejecting some of the outer layers in the process. Because of the highly flattened envelope structure, mass ejection was easiest in the polar direction and occurred there first. Whether mass was ejected in the equatorial direction depended on the amount of energy injected. If it was less than about one-third the binding energy of the envelope, the large mass concentration in the equatorial plane inhibited equatorial mass ejection (20); particles that tried to escape in the equatorial direction were deflected by the large equatorial mass concentration toward higher latitudes (Fig. 2C). This produced a large density enhancement in the ejecta at roughly 45. Indeed, it is the over-density at mid-latitude that would ultimately be swept up to form the outer rings in the SN 1987A nebula. In our best model, no matter was ejected in the equatorial direction. However, because the merged object has much more angular momentum than a more compact blue supergiant could have, the merged object has to lose this excess angular momentum, most likely in the form of a slow equatorial outflow (22), as it shrinks to become a blue supergiant. We estimated that, for typical parameters, most likely several solar masses would need to be lost in this transition phase (21). Once the merged object has become a blue supergiant, its energetic blue-supergiant wind will start to sweep up all the structures ejected previously. To model the blue-supergiant phase, we started a second SPH calculation in which we only simulated the ejecta. For the initial model of this calculation, we took the output from the first simulation once the ejecta expanded freely. This gives the mass and the velocity of the ejecta as a function of latitude. We then ballistically extrapolated the evolution of the ejecta for 4000 years, the assumed time of the red-blue transition. We modeled the equatorial mass shedding by including an equatorial outflow, lasting for 2000 years (21). We then introduced a spherically symmetric blue-supergiant wind (with a mass-loss rate of M = 2 * 10-7M year-1 and wind velocity vw = 500 km s-1) and observed the subsequent evolution. In a typical simulation, after 1/220,000 years (Fig. 2D), the density enhancement at mid-latitude had been swept up into two well-defined rings, which together with the swept-up equatorial outflow produced the main features of the triple-ring nebula when observed at an inclination of 1/245 (Fig. 2E). The Hubble Space Telescope image (4) of the nebula shows that the symmetry center of the outer rings is slightly displaced from the symmetry axis of the central ring. This asymmetry can be easily explained if the ejecta associated with the merger are given a small velocity kick of 1/22 km s-1 in a direction to the northwest of the nebula, at an angle of 11 out of the equatorial ring plane. This was done to produce the model shown in Fig. 2E, which almost perfectly reproduces not only the main features of the triple-ring nebula but also the small asymmetries of the outer rings (such as their deviations from perfect ellipses and their displacement from the central symmetry axis). To generate this emission model (21), we assumed that the nebula was fully ionized by the supernova explosion and that the emission was optically thin. This best model also reproduces the kinematics of both the inner ring (23) and the outer rings (4). In this particular model, the inner ring contains 0.4 M of mass, whereas the outer rings contain a total of 0.02 M each. The physical origin of this small kick is not entirely clear. It could be associated with a nonradial pulsational mode excited during the early spiral-in phase; alternatively, it could be due to the orbital motion caused by a more distant low-mass third star in the system. In addition to the three rings, the model predicts several other structures. The outer rings form the ends of two bipolar lobes that, combined with the bow-shock structure around the inner ring, are reminiscent of an hourglass nebula (Fig. 2D). This structure is presumably the origin of the hourglass structure that has been inferred from light-echo studies (24). Further light echoes have also been detected from beyond the triple-ring structure (25); these were most likely formed during the earlier red-supergiant phase of the primary star before the merger or in the phase immediately preceding the merger, where accretion on the companion may produce a bipolar outflow (26). These phases were not included in our simulations. The hydrodynamical model we present here provides an excellent fit to the observed triple-ring nebula around SN 1987A. Notably, this model does not require any physically ad hoc assumptions, and all of the input parameters are compatible with the values expected from simple modeling of the various phases of the merger (apart from the physical origin of the small kick given to the ejecta, which is presently not explained). The model also makes several predictions, specifically about the mass in the different rings and other structures. These may ultimately become visible when the supernova ejecta begin destroying the nebula or when the emergent x-ray flux resulting from the supernova-ring interaction re-ionizes the nebula. In our favored model, the outer rings are ejected before the core material is dredged up, whereas the inner ring is ejected afterward. This distinction suggests some chemical differences between the inner ring and the outer rings-namely, that the inner ring should show a larger helium enhancement and more evidence for CNO processing than the outer rings. This may already have been observed (27) but needs to be confirmed in a more detailed comparative study.
Abstract Despite substantial advances in crystal structure determination methodology for polycrystalline materials, some problems have remained intractable. A case in point is the zeolite catalyst IM-5, whose structure has eluded determination for almost 10 years. Here we present a charge-flipping structure-solution algorithm, extended to facilitate the combined use of powder diffraction and electron microscopy data. With this algorithm, we have elucidated the complex structure of IM-5, with 24 topologically distinct silicon atoms and an unusual two-dimensional medium-pore channel system. This powerful approach to structure solution can be applied without modification to any type of polycrystalline material (e.g., catalysts, ceramics, pharmaceuticals, complex metal alloys) and is therefore pertinent to a diverse range of scientific disciplines. As a result of impressive methodological advances in recent years, the determination of a crystal structure from powder diffraction data is no longer a rarity (1, 2). However, some problems have remained intractable. The prospect of dealing successfully with such cases has been improved recently by two developments. First, the charge-flipping structure-solution algorithm introduced by Oszlanyi and Suto in 2004 for single-crystal data (3, 4) has been adapted to accommodate powder diffraction data (5). The resulting powder charge-flipping (pCF) algorithm implemented in the program Superflip (6) has been shown to work well with both organic and inorganic materials of varying complexities. The second advance involves the inclusion of crystallographic phases obtained from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images in the input to the zeolite-specific program FOCUS (7). This approach led to the solution of the extremely complex structure of the polycrystalline zeolite TNU-9 (8). We reasoned that by including crystallographic phases from HRTEM images in the pCF algorithm, a powerful and generally applicable approach to structure solution for polycrystalline materials could be developed. We were particularly eager to apply this method to the polycrystalline zeolite catalyst IM-5, whose structure has eluded determination for almost 10 years. The synthesis of the high-silica zeolite IM-5 was reported in 1998 (9), and the general features of its pore system were deduced from catalytic test reactions in 2000 (10). Although the material has proven to be an important thermally stable catalyst for hydrocarbon cracking and NO reduction (11-16), its properties cannot be fully understood without detailed crystal structure information. Like many zeolitic materials, IM-5 is polycrystalline, but this alone does not account for the particular challenge posed by its structure analysis. It has an unusually large unit cell (C-centered orthorhombic with a = 14.299 A, b = 57.413 A, and c = 20.143 A) with a volume almost triple that of ZSM-5 (17), one of the more complex known zeolites. There are also approximatep relationships between the axes (b 1/24a and c 1/22a), which means that symmetrically unrelated reflections (e.g., 200 and 080 or 022 and 060) have very similar d spacings. These factors result in an enormous degree of reflection overlap, which is the key hindrance to structure solution from powder diffraction data (1). Furthermore, impurities, which complicate any powder diffraction data analysis, are common in IM-5 syntheses. We overcame these difficulties by combining powder diffraction and electron microscopy techniques in a charge-flipping structure-solution algorithm. This study builds on our prior adaptation of the charge-flipping algorithm to accommodate powder diffraction data (5). The algorithm itself is a deceptively simple one. Structure factor amplitudes (|Fhkl|), derived from the measured diffraction intensities (Ihkl), are assigned random crystallographic phases (|Fhkl|), and the corresponding (random) electron density map [(xyz)] is generated with the equation (1) Then the signs of all electron density pixels below a user-defined threshold value (a small positive number close to zero) are reversed (hence "charge flipping") to produce a modified electron density map. Essentially, all negative electron densities (which are not physically meaningful) are made positive. From this map, a new set of structure factor amplitudes and phases is calculated. The new phases are then combined with the measured amplitudes to produce a new electron density map. This cycle is repeated until convergence (calculated amplitudes matching measured ones) is reached. An R value comparing the calculated and measured amplitudes provides an estimate of the reliability of the final map. In a powder diffraction pattern, reflections with similar d spacings (or diffraction angle 2) overlap, obscuring their individual intensities. To improve the initial estimate of these intensities (usually a simple equipartitioning) during the course of a pCF run, we introduced a periodic repartitioning within each overlap group. In our implementation, this repartitioning procedure involves an additional density modification based on histogram matching (18) and is performed after a user-defined number of cycles of charge flipping. Wu and co-workers use the charge-flipping modification itself for this repartitioning step (19). The advantages of the charge-flipping algorithm are twofold. First, all calculations are performed without any assumptions about the symmetry, thereby side-stepping space group ambiguities, common in powder diffraction data. Second, no chemical information (e.g., bond distances, bond angles, atom connectivity) is required, so the technique can be applied to any class of material. The question was whether or not this algorithm could handle a problem as complex as the structure of IM-5. In parallel to the development of the pCF algorithm, we were exploring ways of combining the complementary aspects of powder diffraction and electron microscopy techniques for structure determination. In the case of TNU-9 (8) mentioned earlier, intensities extracted from high-resolution powder diffraction data were combined with crystallographic phases obtained from HRTEM images in the zeolite-specific program FOCUS (7). We reasoned that a similar approach could be used for IM-5, except that the information from the two techniques would be combined in the pCF algorithm rather than in FOCUS. Because the pCF algorithm operates in both real (electron density) and reciprocal (phase) space, it is relatively easy to add supplementary information in either realm. For example, a partial or approximate model can be introduced in real space as a starting electron density map, instead of the usual random phase map; a (partial) pore system in a zeolite can be defined in real space in terms of a structure envelope (20); or phase information from HRTEM images can be added in reciprocal space. High-resolution powder diffraction data were collected from several different samples of IM-5 at the Swiss-Norwegian Beamlines (SNBL) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, and the Swiss Light Source (SLS) in Villigen. None of the samples were ideal. All contained impurities, none had particularly sharp peaks, and diffraction intensity decreased rapidly with diffraction angle. Indeed, the main difference between IM-5 and TNU-9 in terms of the difficulty of the structure determination lies in the inferior quality of the IM-5 powder diffraction data. Nonetheless, by comparing the different IM-5 patterns, the peaks corresponding to the IM-5 phase could be distinguished from those of the various impurities, and a tentative indexing of the patterns achieved. In some patterns, the impurity peaks could be assigned to known materials, but in others they remained unidentified. Because of the relationships between the axes mentioned earlier and the quality of the data, the indexing was uncertain and the cell difficult to refine. Generally, determining the unit cell from a powder diffraction pattern is a straightforward and accurate procedure. However, when reflection overlap is extreme and/or when unidentified impurities are present, electron diffraction is a valuable complementary technique. Because electrons interact much more strongly with atoms than do x-rays, a single-crystal electron diffraction pattern can be obtained from a very tiny crystallite (dimensions of 1/220 nm versus 1/220 1/2m for x-rays). Unfortunately, this strong interaction generally results in intensities that are difficult or impossible to interpret directly. However, the single-crystal nature of the diffraction patterns allows impurities to be discriminated from the main phase and reflections with similar d spacings to be distinguished from one another. We therefore collected series of selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns on different crystallites of IM-5 as they were tilted around various axes. The SAED patterns from each tilt series were combined with the programs ELD (21) and Trice (22) to construct a three-dimensional (3D) reciprocal lattice, from which approximate lattice parameters could be determined. These results confirmed the powder indexing. The systematic absences in the SAED patterns indicated that the most probable space groups were Cmc21, C2cm, and Cmcm. The powder diffraction pattern exhibiting the sharpest peaks and the largest range in d spacings (2) was selected for further analysis. First, the analcime impurity peaks were subtracted from this pattern, and then a set of reflection intensities were extracted assuming the space group Cmcm. Of the 4120 reflections in the pattern (dmin = 1.05 A), 3499 were within 0.2 * FWHM (full width at half maximum) of another reflection, forming 862 overlap groups. To optimize the relative intensities within the overlap groups, the FIPS (fast iterative Patterson squaring) routine was applied (23). These intensities were expanded to the space group P1 (no symmetry within the unit cell) and used as input to the pCF program. Although some of the resulting electron density maps showed feasible pore systems, none could be interpreted to a level sufficient for structure determination. There were indications in these maps that the assignment of a mirror plane perpendicular to the a axis (in Cmcm) might be erroneous. To resolve this issue, we took high-quality HRTEM images of IM-5 along the three main zone axes at 300 kV on a JEM-3010 transmission electron microscope (Fig. 1). A Fourier transform was calculated from a thin area near the crystal edge in each image, and structure factor amplitudes and phases were extracted with the program CRISP (24). Note that crystallographic phases, which are lost in diffraction experiments, can be retrieved from HRTEM images. These phases were analyzed to determine the symmetry of each projection, and the combination of the three different projections supported the assignment of the noncentrosymmetric space group C2cm (standard setting Ama2). Consequently, the phase relations and phase restrictions of the space group C2cm were imposed on the amplitudes and phases extracted from the HRTEM images of each projection. The contrast transfer function was determined from the Fourier transform of each image and compensated with the program CRISP, after which the projected potential maps (insets in Fig. 1) were calculated.

Insets show the corresponding selected-area electron diffraction patterns (left), the symmetry-averaged images (middle), and the simulated images from the structural model (right). The crystal thicknesses for the simulations were 50, 50, and 750 A, and the defocus values were -500, -400, and +1500 A, respectively. The structure factor amplitudes and phases from the three HRTEM projections were combined to produce a 3D set of 95 structure factors. Common reflections were used to scale the amplitudes and to determine the common origin of the different projections (25). A 3D potential map was then calculated by inverse Fourier transformation with the program eMap (26). In this potential map, 36 unique Si-atom positions were located and then adjusted to produce a four-connected framework structure. Oxygen bridges were added between the connected Si atoms, and the geometry was optimized with the distance least-squares program DLS-76 (27). However, the R value of the optimization (comparison of calculated and ideal distances) indicated that the framework was highly strained. Furthermore, the powder diffraction pattern generated from this model did not fit the measured one very well, even after structure refinement. The 95 phases derived from the HRTEM images were then included in the pCF routine, along with a structure envelope (20) defining the channels along [100] and [001] (Fig. 1, A and B). The structure envelope was used to eliminate electron density within the channels. However, the resulting electron density maps were not improved sufficiently over the earlier ones for meaningful interpretation. Speculating that the model derived from the HRTEM data was probably partially correct, we used it to calculate alternative starting electron density maps to replace the initial map generated by the use of random phases. The phase of each reflection calculated from the structure was varied by up to 25% in random fashion, thereby generating 1000 different starting points for 1000 distinct pCF runs. During the course of each run, the channel system was enforced periodically by applying the structure envelope restriction. The resulting maps were symmetry averaged assuming the space group C2cm, and then the five best maps (lowest pCF R values) were combined to yield the one shown in Fig. 2.

A stick model of the final refined structure of IM-5 has been superimposed for comparison. The image was produced with the UCSF Chimera package (30). Interpretation of this map was almost trivial. The positions of 35 of the 36 Si atoms and 61 of the 79 O atoms could be located directly in the top 106 peaks. The position of the missing Si atom could be deduced quite easily from the four surrounding Si atoms. Two of the other Si atoms had to be shifted by 1/20.1 A along the c axis to complete the four-connected framework structure. The positions of the missing oxygen bridges were then generated, and the geometry was optimized with DLS-76 (27). This time, the DLS R value was indicative of an unstrained geometry, and the calculated powder diffraction pattern matched the main features of the measured one. The framework structure appeared to be consistent with the centrosymmetric space group Cmcm, so we began Rietveld refinement of the structure assuming this symmetry. To simplify the refinement, we used data collected on a calcined sample (i.e., one in which the organic molecules in the pores had been removed by heat treatment) [a = 14.2088(3) A, b = 57.2368(13) A, c = 19.9940(2) A], even though the peaks were not as sharp as those in the pattern used for the structure determination. Soft geometric restraints were placed on the bond distances and angles of the atoms of the framework, and the refinement converged with the structure factor, weighted profile (Rwp), and statistically expected R values 0.075, 0.188, and 0.142, respectively (Fig. 3). Strong anisotropic peak broadening along two crystallographic directions (e.g., peak widths of 0.026, 0.060, and 0.0682 for reflections with similar 2 values, but orthogonal orientations) was observed and could only be modeled approximately. The high Rwp value stems mainly from this complication, as well as a particularly irregular background that was difficult to estimate and the presence of an unidentified impurity. Nonetheless, the refinement of the structure itself was extremely stable. Although 12 of the 24 Si atoms in the asymmetric unit lie on the mirror plane perpendicular to the a axis, the geometry remained reasonable, with the possible exception of the 180 Si-O-Si angle at O(25), which lies on a center of symmetry. Reducing the symmetry to one of the non-centrosymmetric C-centered subgroups of Cmcm (C2cm, C2221, or Cmc21) did not result in any substantial improvement in either the profile fit or the geometry, so the higher space group Cmcm was retained. It is possible that the calcined form of IM-5, which was used for the refinement, adopts a symmetry higher than that of the assynthesized form, which was used for all the other analyses.

Observed (top), calculated (middle), and difference (bottom) diffraction profiles for the Rietveld refinement of calcined IM-5 ( = 0.99995 A). The higher-angle data have been scaled up by a factor of 4 to show more detail. Tick marks indicate the positions of the reflections. A small section of the low-angle data has been expanded in the inset to illustrate the high degree of reflection overlap even in the large d-spacing range. Three clearly separated impurity peaks are marked with asterisks. With 24 topologically distinct Si atoms, the framework structure of IM-5 (see data file S1 for IM-5 crystallographic information) is as complex as that of TNU-9, the most complex zeolite hitherto solved (8). For comparison, the next most complex zeolite, ITQ-22 (28), has only 16 topologically distinct (Si,Ge) atoms. The [001] projection (Fig. 1B) of IM-5 is very similar to one found in several other high-silica zeolites [Ferrierite, ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-57, SUZ-4, Theta-1, and TNU-9 (29)]. However, the connectivity along [001] is different and leads to an unusual pore system (Fig. 4). As suggested by the catalytic tests (10), IM-5 has a 2D 10-ring (10 Si atoms and 10 O atoms in the ring describing the pore opening) channel system with effective pore widths ranging from 4.8 to 5.5 A. What is unusual is that this channel system also has a limited third dimension. Three 2D channel systems running perpendicular to the b axis are connected to one another to form a 1/22.5-nm-thick pore system. Single walls of four, five, and six rings (Fig. 4A) separate these nanoslabs from one another. This distinctive pore structure (Fig. 4B) gives IM-5 the character of a 3D channel system with complex channel intersections that can accommodate bulky intermediates in a catalytic reaction, while retaining the overall effect of a 2D one with long-range diffusion restricted to just two dimensions.

(B) A single 2D channel system [between the walls marked in (A)], showing more detail of the connectivity. The details of the shape and size of the structure envelope (generated from 21 reflections) used to depict the channel system are only approximate and should not be overinterpreted. The envelope is only meant to indicate the approximate arrangement of the channels within the framework structure. The image was produced with the UCSF Chimera package (30). Because no symmetry is assumed, the number of atoms per unit cell rather than the number per asymmetric unit is the prime limitation of the pCF algorithm. For IM-5, this number is 864 (288 Si atoms + 576 O atoms). Therefore, the structures of other polycrystalline materials with similar numbers of atoms per unit cell, whether they be other catalysts, ceramics, pharmaceuticals, or complex metal alloys, should also be accessible via a similar route, provided that HRTEM images can be obtained. All of the enhancements to the charge-flipping approach discussed here have been implemented in the freely available program Superflip (Superflip input file for IM-5 is given in data file S2) (6).
Abstract The connection between a surface's metric and its Gaussian curvature (Gauss theorem) provides the base for a shaping principle of locally growing or shrinking elastic sheets. We constructed thin gel sheets that undergo laterally nonuniform shrinkage. This differential shrinkage prescribes non-Euclidean metrics on the sheets. To minimize their elastic energy, the free sheets form three-dimensional structures that follow the imposed metric. We show how both large-scale buckling and multiscale wrinkling structures appeared, depending on the nature of possible embeddings of the prescribed metrics. We further suggest guidelines for how to generate each type of feature. Thin sheets are common in natural and man-made structures, are shaped to a huge variety of diverse three-dimensional (3D) structures, and span many length scales (1). Natural slender structures, such as flowers, lichens, and marine invertebrates, attain elaborate configurations during their unconfined (free) growth. One wonders what mechanisms lead to shaping of free sheets and whether they can be implemented with artificial materials. Thin sheets can form nontrivial 3D structures in many different ways. Confinement of flat sheets can lead to buckling (2), wrinkling (3), and crumpling (4). The construction of layered material can result in both bending (5, 6) and wrinkling (7, 8). Recent studies of wavy patterns along edges of torn plastic sheets (9-11) have shown that 3D wavy patterns can result from inplane deformations. Mathematically, a structure made of a thin sheet can be viewed as a two-dimensional (2D) surface in a 3D Euclidean space. Intrinsically, a surface is characterized by its metric, a tensor that specifies the local distances between points across the surface (12). The shape of a surface, its configuration in space, is a realization, an embedding, of the metric in space. In many cases, there would be many possible embeddings of a given 2D surface (metric) in space; that is, the metric alone does not determine a configuration. To select a specific shape (a specific embedding), one needs to determine, in addition to the metric, the local curvatures on the surface (13). We present a shape selection principle based on two main ideas: The first is Gauss theorem (Theorema Egregium), which states that the metric tensor of a surface locally determines its Gaussian curvature K(x,y). The second principle, known from the study of crumpling (14-16), shell collapse (17), and wrinkling (18), states that equilibria of thin elastic sheets involve only small amount of inplane strain. Combined, these two principles lead to a novel shaping mechanism: Rather than aiming at a specific embedding, one prescribes on the sheet only a 2D metric, the "target metric" gtar, one that results in a nonzero Gaussian curvature (a non-Euclidean metric). A sheet adopting a configuration (embedding) satisfying gtar would have been completely free of inplane strain, that is, stretching energy. The free sheet will settle to a 3D configuration that minimizes its elastic energy. In this mechanism, the selected configuration is set by the competition between bending and stretching energies, and its metric will be close to (but different from) gtar. We show that the construction of elastic sheets with various target metrics is possible and results in spontaneous formation of 3D structures. These structures exist in both large-scale buckling and small-scale wrinkling forms. We further suggest guidelines for how to generate each type of feature. Being free in space and not locked onto a specific embedding, these sheets undergo morphological transitions, driven by global constraints on possible embeddings of their target metrics. We used N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) gels to construct sheets with inducible non-Euclidean gtar. The gels are produced by mixing NIPA monomers with bisacrylamide (BIS) (6% by weight of NIPA) cross-linker in water. The addition of catalysts initiates polymerization of a cross-linked elastic hydrogel [
Abstract We present an approach for subwavelength focusing of microwaves using both a time-reversal mirror placed in the far field and a random distribution of scatterers placed in the near field of the focusing point. The far-field time-reversal mirror is used to build the time-reversed wave field, which interacts with the random medium to regenerate not only the propagating waves but also the evanescent waves required to refocus below the diffraction limit. Focal spots as small as one-thirtieth of a wavelength are described. We present one example of an application to telecommunications, which shows enhancement of the information transmission rate by a factor of 3. Subwavelength information about an object is carried by evanescent waves. As they decay exponentially, these evanescent waves are generally lost before reaching the far-field image plane, which is the origin of the diffraction limit. One approach to recover evanescent waves in near-field microscopy is to place a subwavelength scatterer in the near field of the object to be imaged. By diffracting off the scatterer, evanescent waves can convert into propagating waves, which can then be detected in the far field. In the past decade, several schemes for detecting evanescent waves were introduced (1, 2). They use either a subwavelength-sized aperture or a sharp stylus that samples the field very close () to the specimen to be imaged. More recently, superlenses have been proposed for imaging beyond the diffraction limit (3-5). These discoveries followed the original descriptions of negative refraction and perfect imaging of quasistatic line sources (6, 7). Such superlenses consist of thin slabs of materials with negative permittivity, permeability, or both (4, 5, 8-11). Recently a cylindrical lens relying on anisotropic metamaterials has also been theoretically proposed (12). Superlenses transmit evanescent waves with enhanced amplitude, in contrast to conventional materials. Thus, evanescent components radiated by an object can be recovered in the image plane. In contrast with near-field microscopy, which requires a point-by-point scanning, superlenses form the whole image at once. One drawback is that in all existing experimental verifications, the image still forms in the near-field zone of the superlens and a scanning near-field microscopy technique must be used to create the far-field image (13). Our approach for subwavelength focusing uses a focusing aperture placed in the far field. The idea is to build a microstructured medium in the near field of the point where one intends to focus and to use a time-reversal mirror (TRM) placed in the far field to build the time-reversed wave field that will focus at the target without being subject to the diffraction limit. The time-reversal technique is well known in acoustics and has led to a number of applications in ultrasound and underwater acoustics, such as brain therapy, lithotripsy, and nondestructive testing, as well as in telecommunications (14). In a typical time-reversal experiment, an acoustic source is placed at the location where one intends to focus. First, this source sends out a short pulse. The wave field propagates and is recorded with a set of transducers located on a surface. Second, the recorded signals are flipped in time. Third, the flipped signals are transmitted back by the same set of transducers acting as transmitters. The resulting wave is found to converge back to its initial source. At best, if the transducers are located on a closed surface surrounding the original source, forming a closed TRM, the time-reversed wave converges from all directions. However, even if the original source is pointlike, the focal spot is not. Indeed, as the amplitude of the evanescent waves decays exponentially, a closed TRM located in the far field cannot sense and retransmit the evanescent components. Therefore, the time-reversed field produces a /2 focal spot in agreement with the diffraction limit. In practice, a closed TRM is difficult to realize. The time-reversal operation is usually performed on a limited angular area, but if the time-reversal experiment is conducted inside a reverberant chamber, the diffraction limit can actually be reached, even with a small-aperture TRM (15). In this case, the time-reversed wave focuses from all directions because of reverberation off boundaries. Recently, experimental demonstrations of phase conjugation and broadband time reversal were reported for microwaves (16-18). In our microwave time-reversal experiments, a TRM made of eight antennas operating at a central frequency of 2.45 GHz with a bandwidth of 150 MHz was able to focus on a /2 focal spot inside a reverberant chamber. Our approach to recover evanescent waves is to place a random distribution of subwavelength scatterers in the near field of the source. By diffracting off the scatterers, evanescent waves can convert into propagating waves, which can then be detected by the far-field time-reversal mirror. These propagating waves are time-reversed in the far field and transmitted back. Because of the theorem of generalized reciprocity between evanescent waves and propagating waves (19), the part of the far-field time-reversed wave originating from the evanescent waves of the source is converted back into the initial evanescent components, which thus participate in the refocusing process. In contrast to superlenses, evanescent waves are not enhanced here but, as a result of reciprocity, are recovered in the back-propagation step of the time-reversal process. We have applied this idea to microwaves. A source consists of a wire antenna operating at a central frequency of 2.45 GHz (i.e., = 12 cm). To convert the evanescent waves into propagating waves, the antenna is surrounded by a microstructure consisting of a random distribution of thin copper wires located in the near field of the antenna (see details of one antenna in Fig. 1, B and C). In our experiment, we consider eight possible focusing points placed in a strongly reverberating chamber (Fig. 1A). Eight microwave sources surrounded by a random microstructure are placed at these eight locations so that they can be used in the initial step of the time-reversal process. The distance between two adjacent antennas is /30. These eight antennas form an array that will be referred to as the receiving array. A TRM made of eight commercial dipolar antennas is placed in the far field, 10 wavelengths away from the receiving array. (The electronic part of the setup is described in fig. S1.) When antenna 3 sends a short pulse (10 ns), the eight signals received at the TRM are much longer than the initial pulse because of strong reverberation in the chamber (typically 500 ns). An example of the signal received at one of the antennas of the TRM is shown in Fig. 2A. When antenna 4 is used as a source, the signal received at the same antenna in the TRM (shown in Fig. 2B) is considerably different, although sources 3 and 4 are /30 apart. When these signals are time-reversed and transmitted back, the resulting waves converge respectively to antennas 3 and 4, where they recreate pulses as short as the initial ones (Fig. 2, C and D). Measuring the signal received at the other antennas of the receiving array gives access to the spatial focusing around antennas 3 and 4 (Fig. 2E). The two antennas can now be addressed independently, because the focusing spots created around them are much smaller than the wavelength (typically /30). The diffraction limit is overcome, although the focusing points are in the far field of the TRM. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Experimental setup.

(C and D) show the time compression obtained at antennas 3 and 4, respectively, when the eight signals coming from antennas 3 and 4 are time-reversed and sent back from the TRM. (E) In full line are shown the focusing spots obtained around antennas 3 and 4. Their typical width is /30. Thus, antennas 3 and 4 can be addressed independently. The focal spots obtained when there are no copper wires are shown for comparison (dashed-dotted line). All maxima have been normalized by scaling factors in the ratios: 1 (red and blue dashed-dotted lines), 2.2 (red full line), 2.5 (blue full line). The origin of the diffraction limit, and the way to overcome it, can be revisited by using the time-reversal concept and the Green's function formalism, without the explicit use of the evanescent wave concept (20-22). The time-reversed wave, generated by a closed TRM, which converges to its source, is always followed by a spatially diverging wave due to energy flux conservation. Because the focal spot results from the interference of these two waves, the time-reversed field can always be expressed (for a monochromatic wave) as the imaginary part of the Green's function (22). In a homogeneous medium, the imaginary part of the Green's function oscillates typically on a wavelength scale. To create focal spots much smaller than the wavelength, one introduces subwavelength scatterers in the near field of the source. Therefore, the spatial dependence of the imaginary part of the Green's function is modified to oscillate on scales much smaller than the wavelength. A promising application of time-reversal subwavelength focusing is telecommunications. One way that has been proposed to increase the data rate of a communication system is to use multiantenna arrays at both transmitter and receiver (23); different bitstreams sent from each antenna of the transmitting array can be decoded at the receiving array under the condition that the medium creates sufficient scattering. It is also generally stated that the spacing between the receiving antennas must be larger than /2 (23). If these two conditions are fulfilled, the global maximum error-free data rate, or "Shannon Capacity," is at best multiplied by the number of transmitting antennas. Such methods are referred to as MIMO (multiple input-multiple output). However, from a practical perspective, it is difficult to ensure that the distance between antennas can be made large enough for this requirement to be satisfied. This difficulty is typically encountered when antennas are placed in a laptop and the telecommunication wavelengths are on the centimeter scale (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi). An illustration of the benefit of time-reversal subwavelength focusing to overcome this difficulty is given in Fig. 3. A three-antenna TRM is used to transmit a color picture to a three-antenna receiving array. The original picture is encoded onto three RGB (red-green-blue) color channels. Each corresponding figure is represented by a bit series giving the gray levels of each pixel on that particular channel. Then the simplest modulation is used (a positive pulse for bit 1, a negative one for bit 0) to create three bitstreams with a data rate of 50 Mbit/s each. The intended global data rate is thus 150 Mbit/s. Time reversal is used to focus each bitstream onto one of the antennas (one antenna for each color) of the receiving array. Then the three bitstreams are decoded and mixed to reconstruct the color image. The communication is performed with two kinds of receiving arrays. The first is "classical"; it consists of three dipolar antennas with a /30 spacing. The second is a microstructured antenna array analogous to the one previously described (Fig. 1). It turns out that the image reconstructed with the classical array is gray-scaled: Its colors are lost. Indeed, subwave-length spaced antennas are strongly coupled, that is, they essentially receive the same signal. Hence, each transmitted pixel is gray because the three different antennas corresponding to the three different color channels receive the same gray levels. However, when the microstructured receiving array is used, each color stream focuses independently at each antenna. Consequently, the relative weights of the RGB components of each pixel are preserved and the image is transmitted without major losses. This experiment shows that our approach allows one to increase the information transfer rate to a given volume of space. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3. Transmission of a color image. Transmission of a color image between a three-antenna TRM and a three-antenna receiving array. The original image is encoded on three RGB channels, and the three corresponding bitstreams are sent from the three antennas of the TRM. With a classical receiving array, the image is gray after decoding (A) because the three antennas coding for the red, green, and blue channels receive the same signal. With a microstructured receiving array, the red, green, and blue signals are focused independently on the three receiving antennas, although these latter are /30 apart from each other. The relative weights between the RGB channels are thus preserved and the color image is restored (B).
Abstract The Clovis complex is considered to be the oldest unequivocal evidence of humans in the Americas, dating between 11,500 and 10,900 radiocarbon years before the present (14C yr B.P.). Adjusted 14C dates and a reevaluation of the existing Clovis date record revise the Clovis time range to 11,050 to 10,800 14C yr B.P. In as few as 200 calendar years, Clovis technology originated and spread throughout North America. The revised age range for Clovis overlaps non-Clovis sites in North and South America. This and other evidence imply that humans already lived in the Americas before Clovis. For nearly 50 years, it has been generally thought that small bands of humans carrying a generalized Upper Paleolithic tool kit entered the Americas around 11,500 radiocarbon years before the present (14C yr B.P.) and that these first immigrants traveled southward through the ice-free corridor separating the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets (1). These people developed the distinctive lithic, bone, and ivory tools of Clovis (2, 3) and then quickly populated the contiguous United States. Clovis humans and their descendants then rapidly populated Central America and reached southernmost South America by 10,500 14C yr B.P. (1). Identifying when the Clovis complex first appeared and knowing the complex's duration is critical to explaining the origin of Clovis, evaluating the Clovis-first model of colonization of the Americas, determining the role of humans in the extinction of late Pleistocene megafauna, and assessing whether people inhabited the Americas before Clovis. We determined a more accurate time span for Clovis by analyzing the revised existing Clovis 14C date record and reporting high-precision accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14C ages from previously dated Clovis sites. Our AMS 14C dates are on culturally specific organic matter-bone, ivory, and seeds-that accelerator mass spectrometers can date accurately (4, 5) to precisions of 30 years at 11,000 14C yr B.P. Clovis technology has strong Old World antecedents, but Clovis-specific traits (e.g., fluted lanceolate projectile points) probably originated in the New World, south of the continental ice sheets (3). Clovis tools and debitage identify and unify archaeological sites over a broad geographic range. Clovis sites and artifacts cluster in North America, especially in the contiguous United States (1). A small number of Clovis artifacts have been recovered from Mexico and possibly as far south as Venezuela (6). Even though Clovis covers a broad geographic range, only 22 Clovis sites in North America have been directly 14C-dated (Fig. 1, Table 1, and table S1). The 14C dates from these sites traditionally place Clovis between 11,500 and 10,900 14C yr B.P. (1, 7, 8). However, the 14C dates from 11 of these sites are problematic and do not provide accurate or precise chronological information to determine the age of Clovis (5).

Three sites (Lubbock Lake, Texas; Kanorado, Kansas; and Indian Creek, Montana) fall within the Clovis age range but lack diagnostic Clovis artifacts (5). The site of Sheriden Cave, Ohio, provides only bracketing ages for Clovis artifacts (5). Questions exist about the accuracy of the 14C dates from Aubrey, Texas (5), where diagnostic Clovis artifacts were found. We obtained three dates from the Sheaman site, Wyoming, that averaged 10,305 15 14C yr B.P. These dates indicate that the Clovis context at Sheaman is mixed with younger cultural materials (5). Finally, associations between Clovis artifacts and 14C-dated faunal remains at two sites (Wally's Beach, Canada; and Union Pacific, Colorado) are unresolved (5). Because of these problems, we excluded the dates from these sites in assessing the age of Clovis. This leaves 11 sites with a total of 43 14C dates (Table 1 and table S1) (5). These sites have assemblages of Clovis artifacts in secure geological contexts. Existing ages from five sites (Anzick, Montana; Paleo Crossing, Ohio; Lehner, Arizona; Murray Springs, Arizona; and Jake Bluff, Oklahoma) already have high-precision 14C dates on credible materials. We obtained nine new ages from seeds and highly purified bone and ivory collagen for five imprecisely dated sites (Lange-Ferguson, South Dakota; Dent, Colorado; Domebo, Oklahoma; Shawnee-Minisink, Pennsylvania; and Colby, Wyoming) (4, 5). In addition, we obtained five ages on human remains from the Anzick site, Montana (5). We attempted to date samples from Sloth Hole, Florida, but the samples contained no collagen. These 43 14C dates place the beginning of Clovis at 1/211,050 14C yr B.P. (reducing former estimates by 450 14C years) and its end at 1/210,800 14C yr B.P. (younger than previous estimates by 100 14C years). Accurate calendar correlation of 14C ages from the Clovis time period is not currently possible because of correlation uncertainties (9). The Clovis-period segment of the INTCAL04 calibration is based on 14C-dated marine foraminifera and is not accurate for the Clovis time period (10). The most accurate calibration for this time period is provided by a floating European tree-ring chronology that is provisionally anchored to INTCAL04 (11). Using this tentative calibration (11), we estimated that Clovis has a maximum possible date range of 13,250 to 12,800 calendar yr B.P.-a span of 450 calendar years (Fig. 2). By taking the youngest possible calibrated age for the oldest Clovis site and the oldest possible calibrated age for the youngest Clovis site, a minimum range for Clovis is calculated as 13,125 to 12,925 calendar yr B.P.-a span of 200 calendar years. The ages for all Clovis sites overlap within this 200-year period, and this time span probably represents the true range of Clovis. However, the absolute calendar placement of the floating tree-ring record is disputed (12). By an alternative calibration (12), the maximum time range for Clovis is 13,110 to 12,660 calendar yr B.P., and the minimum time range is 12,920 to 12,760 calendar yr B.P. (Fig. 3). Regardless of the exact calendar dates, the 200-year duration for Clovis remains secure because the floating dendrochronological sequence provides calendar-year separations between two 14C-dated sites.

Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3. Calendar-year age ranges for Clovis and other early sites based on the Fairbanks calibration (12) at 1 SD. The oldest Clovis sites (n = 3 sites) are located in Montana, South Dakota, and Florida; younger Clovis sites are located in the interior (n = 5) of the United States and in the South-west (n =2) and East (n = 1). The distribution of dated sites shows no clear indication of north-south or east-west age differences that would indicate movement of people in one direction or another. Instead, Clovis technology seems to have appeared synchronously across the United States at 1/211,050 14C yr B.P. This pattern of 14C dates is compatible with two contrasting hypotheses. First, this pattern could support the idea that there was a rapid spread of Clovis people across an empty continent. Demographic models suggest that people exiting the ice-free corridor could have occupied the contiguous United States within 100 years or less (13). Although there is much speculation about a coastal migration of the first Americans from both Asia and Europe (14, 15), the revised date range for Clovis reopens the possibility of a Late Glacial migration through the ice-free corridor that separated the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets. People could have easily traveled through the ice-free corridor after 1/211,500 14C yr B.P. (1)-at least 200 calendar years before the oldest known Clovis date. The biface and blade industry of Nenana (16) was well established at the Broken Mammoth site, Alaska, to 11,770 210 14C yr B.P. (WSU-4351)-at least 300 calendar years before our oldest recalibrated Clovis date. The Nenana lithic assemblage shows strong similarities to the Clovis lithic assemblage (17). It is possible that either Nenana people or others with a biface and blade industry traveled through the corridor, and once south of the ice sheets, they developed the technological hallmarks characteristic of Clovis and spread rapidly across the continent. An alternative interpretation is that the instantaneous appearance of Clovis across North America represents the rapid spread of Clovis technology through a preexisting but culturally and genetically undefined human population in North America (18). In this case, Clovis technology could have been introduced to this population through a Late Glacial migration of Clovis or Clovis progenitors or developed in situ from a pre-Clovis technology already in the Americas. Regardless of which hypothesis is correct, our revised chronology indicates that Clovis technology spread rapidly. Faunal remains associated with dated Clovis sites constrain the timing of the extinction of Proboscideans at the end of the Pleistocene. Mammoths and mastodons were an important source of food and raw materials used to manufacture bone and ivory tools (3), as well as perishable items from soft tissues. Proboscidean remains are associated with seven of the well-dated Clovis sites (Lange-Ferguson, Sloth Hole, Dent, Domebo, Lehner, Murray Springs, and Colby), and the last occurrence of mammoth in the United States is dated at 1/210,900 14C yr B.P. After this time, Clovis and sites of other complexes (e.g., Goshen and Folsom) contained only bison and other extant species. The extinction of mammoth and mastodon coincides with the main florescence of Clovis. Our revised ages for Clovis overlap dates from a number of North American sites that are technologically or culturally not Clovis. The earliest dated sites of the Goshen complex (Mill Iron, Montana; and Hell Gap, Wyoming) (19) overlap the age range of Clovis (Figs. 2 and 3, and Table 1, and table S1). This indicates that Goshen is either coeval with the entire range of Clovis or briefly overlaps the later stages of the Clovis time period. Clovis also overlaps the date for the Arlington Springs human skeleton from Santa Rosa Island, California (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table 1) (20). No artifacts were found with the Arlington Springs human remains, and his cultural affiliation is unknown. The presence of human remains on Santa Rosa Island is unequivocal evidence that water crafts were used during Clovis time and that a Pacific maritime-coastal adaptation was probably contemporaneous with Clovis. At Bonneville Estates Rockshelter, Nevada (21), the earliest date from a series of hearths is coeval with the Clovis time period and is associated with stone artifacts. Diagnostic artifacts have yet to be found at this level, and it is unknown whether this early horizon is associated with Clovis or stemmed points. Several sites in South America have yielded 14C dates that are coeval with Clovis (Figs. 2 and 3). These include the early archaeological horizons at Cerro Tres Tetas, Cueva Casa del Minero, and Piedra Museo, Argentina, and the earliest Fishtail point horizon at Fell's Cave, Chile (Fig. 1, Table 1, and table S1) (8, 22). The actual calendar dates of these South American sites may be slightly more recent because Southern Hemisphere samples have a lower initial 14C content than contemporaneous samples in the Northern Hemisphere. This latitudinal difference causes Southern Hemisphere terrestrial materials to be 5 to 80 14C years older than contemporaneous samples in North America (23). The extent of this interhemisphere offset in 14C years for the Clovis time period is unknown, but it is probably less than 80 years. Even with an 80-year correction to the 14C dates from these four sites, Clovis, Fishtail, and other early complexes in the Southern Cone of South America are still contemporaneous. The presence of non-Clovis sites that are contemporaneous with Clovis in both North and South America implies that Clovis does not represent the earliest occupation of the Americas. It would probably have taken a minimum of 600 to 1000 years for the first Paleoamericans and their descendents to travel by land from the southern limit of the ice-free corridor to Tierra del Fuego (13, 24)-a distance of over 14,000 km (Fig. 1). However, at most 300 to 350 calendar years separate the oldest possible date for Clovis and the youngest possible ages from the well-dated unequivocal sites in southernmost South America (Figs. 2 and 3). The difference is reduced to 200 calendar years, when the minimum date for the beginning of Clovis in North America and the youngest dates for the sites in South America are considered. It is highly improbable that within 200 to 350 calendar years, people entered North America; adapted to biomes ranging from artic tundra to grasslands, deserts, and rainforests; increased in population; and reached the southern tip of South America within the span of 10 to 18 human generations. This suggests that human populations already existed in the New World before Clovis. There is an emerging archaeological record that supports a pre-Clovis human occupation of the Americas. Stone tools and butchered mammoth remains dating to 1/212,500 14C yr B.P. have been found at the Schaefer and Hebior sites in Wisconsin (25, 26). Older butchered mammoth remains dating to 1/213,500 14C yr B.P. have been recovered from the Mud Lake site, Wisconsin (25, 26). In South America, humans appear to have been present at 12,500 14C yr B.P. at Monte Verde, Chile (27). The archaeological data now show that Clovis does not represent the earliest inhabitants of the Americas and that a new model is needed to explain the peopling of the Americas.
Abstract The taxonomic composition of environmental communities is an important indicator of their ecology and function. We used a set of protein-coding marker genes, extracted from large-scale environmental shotgun sequencing data, to provide a more direct, quantitative, and accurate picture of community composition than that provided by traditional ribosomal RNA-based approaches depending on the polymerase chain reaction. Mapping marker genes from four diverse environmental data sets onto a reference species phylogeny shows that certain communities evolve faster than others. The method also enables determination of preferred habitats for entire microbial clades and provides evidence that such habitat preferences are often remarkably stable over time. Microorganisms are estimated to make up more than one-third of Earth's biomass (1). They play essential roles in the cycling of nutrients, interact intimately with animals and plants, and directly influence Earth's climate. Yet our molecular and physiological knowledge of microbes remains surprisingly fragmentary, largely because most naturally occurring microbes cannot be cultivated in the laboratory (2). For characterizing this "unseen majority" of cellular life, the first step is to provide a taxonomic census of microbes in their environments (3-6). This is usually achieved by cloning and sequencing their ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes (most notably the 16S/18S small subunit rRNA). This approach has been extremely successful in revealing the overwhelming diversity of microbial life (7), but it also has some limitations due to quantitative errors: The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) step introduces amplification bias, and it generates chimeric and otherwise erroneous molecules that hamper phylogenetic analysis (8, 9). Shotgun sequencing of community DNA ("metagenomics") provides a more direct and unbiased access to uncultured organisms (10-13): No PCR amplification step is involved, and because no specific primers or sequence anchors are needed, even very unusual organisms can be captured by this technique. Although current metagenomics data are still not entirely free of quantitative distortions (mostly due to sample preparation), remaining biases are bound to diminish further with the optimization of yield and reproducibility of DNA extraction protocols (14-16). To make use of metagenomics data for taxonomic profiling, we analyzed 31 protein-coding marker genes previously shown to provide sufficient information for phylogenetic analysis [they are universal, occur only once per genome, and are rarely transferred horizontally (17)]. We extracted these marker genes from metagenomics sequence data (9), aligned them to a set of hand-curated reference proteins, and used maximum likelihood to map each sequence to an externally provided phylogeny of completely sequenced organisms [tree of life; we used the tree from (17), although any reference tree can be used as long as the marker genes have been sequenced for all its taxa]. Our procedure provides branch length information and confidence ranges for each placement (18) (Fig. 1), allowing statements such as "This unknown sequence evolves relatively fast, is from a proteobacterium (95% confidence), and more specifically, probably from a novel clade related to the Campylobacterales (65% confidence)." The procedure weighs the number of informative residues that are found on each sequence fragment, then adjusts the spread and confidence of its placement in the tree accordingly [after alignment, concatenation, and gap removal, the number of remaining informative residues ranges from 80 to more than 3000 per sequence fragment (9)]. We have implemented the entire phylogenetic assignment protocol as an automated software pipeline with a Web interface that allows submission of sequences online (http://MLtreemap.embl.de). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1. Assessing community taxonomy from metagenomics sequence data. The diagram depicts how a restricted set of marker genes can be used for phylogenetic characterization of community microbes from poorly assembled sequence data. Instances of the marker genes are sought in the sequences and assessed relative to an external tree-of-life phylogeny with the use of maximum likelihood scoring. A central step in the mapping procedure is the assignment of a confidence range for each placement, thereby avoiding overconfident placement of sequence fragments that are short or otherwise uninformative. Jackknife validation of our method [i.e., leaving out various parts of the reference tree and measuring the consequences on placement accuracy (9)] showed that the performance of our method depends on the completeness and balance of the reference tree: The larger the phylogenetic distance to any known relative of an environmental sequence, the less precise is its placement. Overall, the mapping precision is remarkably good, as long as each sequence has some relative from the same phylum among the reference genomes (fig. S2). In contrast, BLAST-based assignments of taxonomy based on "best hit," a frequently used method, are more error-prone: For example, more than 10% of the sequences change to a different domain of life (e.g., changing assignment from Bacteria to Archaea) upon removal of the phylum to which they originally mapped; with our method, such changes are reduced to 0.19% (fig. S2). Moreover, because the best BLAST match always assigns a single organism as the most likely phylogenetic neighbor, it does not specify the level of relatedness (e.g., class-, order-, or phylum-level), which is needed to trace organisms in their preferred habitats and through time. In one of the recent, large-scale metagenomics sequencing projects (12), traditional PCR-based assessment of 16S rRNA molecules was executed in parallel to the shotgun sequencing. This enabled us to compare our approach to this currently most widely used experimental method for phylogenetic profiling of environments. Overall, the relative abundances of phyla as reported by both methods were broadly similar, although the metagenomics approach appears quantitatively closer to the truth, as can be measured by comparison to rRNAs that are contained directly in the PCR-independent shotgun reads (9). The PCR-based approach presumably suffers from amplification biases and from copy number variations among rRNA genes in bacteria (19) but benefits from an exhaustive coverage of phyla among known rRNA sequences. In contrast, the approach we present here requires far more resources in terms of sequencing and computation, but, at least for phyla already represented among fully sequenced genomes, it is noticeably more quantitative. Our approach should essentially be seen as a by-product of metagenomics sequencing projects, which are usually conducted for functional purposes [see (9) for a discussion of the strengths, weaknesses, and complementarities of both approaches]. We applied our procedure to four large, heterogeneous data sets of microbial community sequences derived from distinct and geographically separate environments (11-13). The consistent treatment of the data allowed us to quantitatively compare habitat preferences in the context of the tree of life (Fig. 2 and fig. S1; see also fig. S3 for robustness estimates).

(C) Comparison of cultured microbial strains, plotting habitat similarity against their level of relatedness in the NCBI taxonomy. For the taxonomic level of order, and all closer relations, the difference is highly significant (P - and -proteobacteria, which has been tentatively dated at more than 500 million years ago (22-24), clearly enough time for functional capabilities and lifestyles to have changed. Thus, the closest sequenced relative of an environmental microbe should generally not be considered as a reliable guide for its phenotypes and functions. The environments we analyzed contained a few sequences that were placed unusually deep in the tree (i.e., basal to the three known domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota). Upon closer inspection, we determined that most of these deep placements in fact originated from lineages not yet represented among sequenced genomes. Therefore, it is likely that the remaining deep placements will also find a home as soon as more lineages are included in the reference tree, rather than belonging to a hypothetical "fourth domain" of life. The maximum likelihood branch lengths, as measured by our method, provide detailed information on the community-wide distribution of evolutionary rates (that is, the rates at which mutations occur and are fixed). We therefore assessed, for each sequence fragment placed into the tree, the cumulative branch length from the tip of its branch down to the base of the corresponding phylum, and compared these to the branch lengths of all known reference organisms in that same phylum, measured for the very gene families found on the fragment (Fig. 3; very deeply placed fragments are compared to all phyla in their sister clade). Although not all 31 of the marker genes were present for each organism in the metagenomics data, the measurements of relative rates in each gene family revealed distinct branch length distributions for the four environmental communities tested. These indicate that organisms at the ocean surface evolve the fastest, whereas organisms in the soil evolve the slowest (Fig. 3). Large-scale trends like this, involving entire communities, were previously observed mainly for multicellular organisms [e.g., a dependency between latitudinal geographic location and mutation rates in plants (25)]. In the case of microbes, fast-evolving species were previously known in the context of symbiotic or pathogenic settings or in cases of extreme genome "streamlining" (21, 26). The more subtle, global variations in mutation rates reported here may be caused by differences in population sizes or generation times, or by the abundance of external mutagens (such as the strong fluxes of ultraviolet light in ocean surface water). Notably, the ocean surface community is not only evolving the fastest, it is also the one with the smallest genomes (27). In the case of soil, the apparent evolutionary stability at the sequence level is also consistent with intermittent periods of dormancy (for example, during winter and/or under desiccation). Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 3. Distinct evolutionary rates of environmental communities. Organisms found in the surface waters of the Sargasso Sea have accumulated, on average, the largest number of mutations (i.e., evolved fastest), those in the agricultural soil the fewest. For each data set, the branch lengths of the placements are plotted as dots. Each branch length is expressed relative to the median of branch lengths of known genomes in the same phylum, or against all phyla in the sister clade in the case of very deep placements. The quantiles 5%, 25%, 50% (median), 75%, and 95% are indicated. All data sets differ highly significantly (two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, P 10-5, except for the comparison of acidic mine drainage with whale bone: P < 0.05). The number of data points underlying each distribution is as follows: ocean surface water, 15,741 genes on 9,286 contigs; acidic mine drainage, 275 genes on 148 contigs; deep-sea whale bones (three subsamples pooled), 630 genes on 362 contigs; agricultural soil, 598 genes on 395 contigs. Our tree-based mapping (with an implicit molecular clock) also allowed us to trace the habitat preference of microbial organisms through time, and thus enabled us to estimate how frequently lineages change their preferred environment. At short to intermediate evolutionary time scales, we observed a noticeable stability of habitats: Many of the closer relatives in the tree showed the same environmental preference, indicating that microbial lineages do not very often change (or specialize) their lifestyles and habitats (Fig. 2). Conversely, at longer time scales, we did observe notable changes of preferred habitats-for example, within diverse lineages of at least two phyla, namely Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria; this is consistent with the observed morphological and ecological variability of cultured isolates from most phyla. In the case of Cyanobacteria, we identified relatives of the fast-evolving and widespread Prochlorococci in the ocean sample, whereas more basal, slower-evolving Cyanobacteria such as Gloeobacter were mostly found in the soil sample. Even though molecular methods tend to find most phyla ubiquitously, Baas-Becking and Beyerinck postulated decades ago that microbial taxa have preferred environments: "for microbial taxa, everything is everywhere-but the environment selects" [(28) and references therein]. The hypothesis posits that microorganisms are frequently dispersed globally, and that they are only subsequently selected by the environments on the basis of their functional capacities. Existing communities would thus constantly be challenged by intruders from nonspecialist phyla that may occasionally survive simply by chance, acquiring the necessary functionality through horizontal gene transfer (29-31). Our observations provide quantitative support for this hypothesis, showing strong environmental preference along lineages, but with a time-dependent decay. We confirmed and extended this finding by also analyzing habitat information available for cultivated strains in culture collections, as well as the large body of publicly available rRNA sequence data. Both data sets provide information about hundreds of habitats and allow an approximate ranking of lineage separation events in time. In the case of rRNA sequence data, branch length information can be analyzed using a global phylogeny of small subunit RNA sequences, whereas in the case of cultivated strains, taxonomic assignments can be parsed for the last taxonomic rank still shared (9). Indeed, we observe a remarkable time-dependent stability of habitats and show that for any two microbial isolates, the similarity of their annotated habitat (as measured by automated keyword comparisons) is strongly correlated to their evolutionary relatedness (Fig. 2, B and C). We observe such common habitat preferences surprisingly far back in time: Even strains related only at the level of taxonomic order are still significantly more frequently found in the same environment than a random pair of isolates (Fig. 2C). Thus, most microbial lineages remain associated with a certain environment for extended time periods, and successful competition in a new environment seems to be a rare event. The latter might require more than just the acquisition of a few essential functions; probably only a limited number of functionalities are self-sufficient enough, and provide sufficient advantage, to be pervasively transferred (32). For most other adaptations, fine-tuned regulation and/or subtle changes in the majority of proteins may be needed. Because this is difficult to achieve, well-adapted specialists might in fact rarely be challenged in their environment. This does not rule out the presence of a "long tail" of rare, atypical organisms in each environment (33), but most microbial clades do seem to have a preferred habitat. Taken together, our alternative approach of taxonomic profiling of complex communities has sufficient resolution to uncover differences in evolutionary rates of entire communities, as well as long-lasting habitat preferences for bacterial clades. The latter raises the question of how many distinct environmental habitats there are on Earth-a factor that might ultimately determine the true extent of microbial biodiversity.
Abstract The Staphylococcus aureus Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a pore-forming toxin secreted by strains epidemiologically associated with the current outbreak of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) and with the often-lethal necrotizing pneumonia. To investigate the role of PVL in pulmonary disease, we tested the pathogenicity of clinical isolates, isogenic PVL-negative and PVL-positive S. aureus strains, as well as purified PVL, in a mouse acute pneumonia model. Here we show that PVL is sufficient to cause pneumonia and that the expression of this leukotoxin induces global changes in transcriptional levels of genes encoding secreted and cell wall-anchored staphylococcal proteins, including the lung inflammatory factor staphylococcal protein A (Spa). The combined actions of many virulence factors enable Staphylococcus aureus to cause disease (1, 2). Depending on these factors and on the immune status of the host, staphylococci can cause diseases ranging from superficial skin infections to deep-seated and systemic conditions such as osteomyelitis, septic shock, and necrotizing pneumonia. Staphylococcal necrotizing pneumonia can affect young, immunocompetent patients. This disease, characterized by leukopenia, hemoptysis, and extensive necrosis of the lung tissue, is caused by S. aureus strains that produce Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) (3). S. aureus PVL-positive strains are often methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and, in the USA, they are the predominant cause of community-associated infections (4). PVL is a bi-component, pore-forming exotoxin (5) that targets cells of the immune system such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). The active form of PVL requires the assembly of two polypeptides, LukS-PVand LukF-PV, into a heterooligomeric pore. Although PVL has potent cytolytic and inflammatory activities in vitro (6, 7), its role in necrotizing pneumonia has not been demonstrated. To analyze the molecular pathogenesis of PVL-expressing S. aureus strains, we have established a murine model of acute primary pneumonia. We infected mice with strains isolated from necrotizing (PVL-positive) or nonnecrotizing (PVL-negative) staphylococcal pneumonia patients (table S1). PVL-positive strains caused murine necrotizing pneumonia with manifestations resembling human disease (fig. S1). In the PVL-positive strains, the lukS-PV and lukF-PV genes are organized as an operon within a phage (SLT, or other similar phages) that could potentially contribute to the virulence of these strains. To define the role of PVL, we developed several isogenic strains (8). A PVL-negative, transformable S. aureus strain was lysogenized with SLT or with a mutated SLT in which the PVL operon (luk-PV) was deleted. We complemented the PVL-negative strains with a plasmid containing the luk-PV operon under the control of its own promoter (table S1). Mice infected with PVL-positive strains showed symptoms of severe illness: lethargy, hunched posture, ruffled fur, and significant weight loss. Lungs from infected mice were examined 48 hours postinoculation. Tissue sections from lungs infected with PVL-positive strains revealed a strong recruitment of neutrophils and significant inflammation in the lung parenchyma, bronchial epithelial damage, tissue necrosis, and hemorrhage (Fig. 1 and table S2). The lungs infected with PVL-negative strains showed normal lung structures, despite some leukocyte infiltration. By contrast, when the PVL-negative strains were complemented with a plasmid encoding PVL, we observed massive tissue damage and 35 to 80% mortality within 24 hours after inoculation (Fig. 1 and fig. S2). We stained lung sections using antibodies against LukS-PV (fig. S3) and showed that the toxin was detected in tissues infected with PVL-positive bacteria.

The protein-inoculated mice recovered the lost weight after 24 hours, whereas those infected with PVL-positive bacteria were still ill at 48 hours (Fig. 1C compared with Fig. 1K); these findings demonstrated that an active bacterial infection is required to cause severe morbidity. Previous studies have demonstrated that PVL-positive strains had increased adherence to injured airway epithelium (3, 9). To examine the expression of surface proteins in these strains, we examined by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) cell wall extracts and supernatants from cultures taken at both the exponential growth phase and the stationary growth phase (Fig. 2). Samples from a PVL-positive strain showed an enhanced expression of at least two cell wall-anchored polypeptides identified as SdrD and protein A (Spa) by N-terminal sequencing and Western analysis (Fig. 2, C to E, and fig. S4). The SdrD and Spa overexpression was not observed in a strain carrying the phage with the deleted luk-PV operon, which indicated that this effect was not mediated by products encoded by other phage genes or by its insertion in the chromosome of S. aureus. PVL-negative strains complemented with the luk-PVoperon in a multicopy plasmid (table S1) also showed an increased expression of Spa during both logarithmic and stationary growth phases (Fig. 2F). A group of polypeptides with apparent molecular masses between 32 and 47.5 kD (Fig. 2B, dots) were present in the supernatants from the PVL-negative, but not the PVL-positive, strains. Some of the secreted polypeptides were identified as proteases by using zymograms (Fig. 2G). Thus, expression of the luk-PV operon resulted in an altered regulation of cell wall-anchored and secreted protein production. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 2.

Spa is a known virulence factor in mouse models of S. aureus infections, including pneumonia (10, 11); therefore, we examined the role of Spa in necrotizing pneumonia. Animals infected with the spa-deleted isogenic strains had less severe symptoms of disease (Fig. 3A). However, the lungs from animals infected with spa-deleted, PVL-positive strains showed localized lesions with massive leukocyte infiltration (fig. S5), which demonstrated that PVL alone was sufficient to cause pneumonia. Complementation of Spa-positive strains with PVL rendered them lethal, whereas the Spa-negative, PVL-plasmid strains did not cause mortality (Fig. 3B). These data suggested that PVL and Spa may act together to cause the overwhelming inflammation and tissue damage that are seen in necrotizing pneumonia.

PVL-positive strains expressed Spa during both exponential and stationary growth phases (Fig. 2). To analyze the effect of PVL on spa transcription, PVL was introduced into mutants deficient in spa regulators. The Spa production was abolished in a sarS-deletion mutant (fig. S6), whether PVL was present or not, which indicated that PVL acts upstream of SarS. To evaluate the transcriptional profile of a PVL-positive strain compared with the PVL-negative strain, we used microarray analysis: 28 genes showed a distinct expression pattern during exponential growth (table S3), whereas, during the stationary phase, 133 genes showed differential expression (table S4). The agr transcripts and several exoproteins were repressed, whereas genes encoding for cell wall-anchored proteins and the spa activator sarS (12) were up-regulated (Fig. 4A). Elevated expression of the spa and sdrD transcripts correlated with the enhanced production of Spa and SdrD observed in Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 and fig. S4). The repression of exoprotein transcripts paralleled the absence of the 32- to 47.5-kD exoproteins in the supernatants of PVL-positive strains (Fig. 2). This pattern of transcription implicated PVL in an interaction with a factor (or factors) that controls gene expression during the transition from the logarithmic growth to stationary phase.

(A) Fold increase or decrease levels of transcript from selected genes. Total RNA extracted from cultures grown to stationary phase. Genes were considered to be induced or repressed in the PVL phage if they were transcribed at least twice or half as much as those of PVL phage. The shown transcripts encode agrA-C, accessory gene regulator system; sarS, staphylococcal accessory regulator S; spa, staphylococcal protein A; sdrD, serine-aspartate repeat protein D; sdrC, serine-aspartate repeat protein C; clfB, clumping factor B; hla, alpha toxin; ssp, a representative of serine proteases sspBand sspC; spl, a representative of splA-F proteases. (B) A schematic overview of the interactions between regulators involved in cell wall-anchored and secreted protein genes (full and broken lines indicate positive and negative regulation, respectively) based on previously published data. Numbers next to the gene name indicate fold change based on microarray analysis (upward arrow indicates up-regulation, downward arrow indicates down-regulation). The down-regulation of RNAIII (the effector of the agr system) results in the down-regulation of secreted protein genes (hla, hlgC, hlgB, and proteases) and the up-regulation of sarS and cell wall-anchored proteins (spa, sdrD, sdrC, clfB). In addition, the up-regulation of sarS results in the up-regulation of spa. The regulatory model proposed here was inferred by using strains derived from RN6390, a strain harboring a deletion in rsbU, which encodes a regulator necessary for the activity of the stress sigma factor B. Strains with a reduced B (13) activity display, among other traits, a decreased production of cell wall-anchored proteins and an increased production of exoproteins. We subsequently generated isogenic PVL-positive and PVL-negative strains in the SH1000 (14) rsbU+ background and observed overexpression of Spa during the stationary phase of growth (fig. S7A). The SH1000-derived PVL-positive strain was more virulent than its PVL-negative isogenic pair (fig. S7, C and D). When compared with RN6390, the SH1000 lineage showed an increased expression of Spa, but produced 20% PVL, although some variability was seen (fig. S7A) (15). This suggested that RsbU/B partially regulates PVL. We show here that PVL is a significant S. aureus virulence factor and that PVL-positive strains can cause murine necrotizing pneumonia with manifestations that resemble those observed in human patients. Our results demonstrate that the expression of the genes that encode PVL (lukS-PVand lukF-PV) or direct inoculation with native toxin is sufficient to induce pneumonia in mice. The expression of the luk-PVoperon also resulted in an altered expression of multiple proteins, including the tightly regulated (16, 17) proinflammatory factor Spa. In PVL-positive strains, many secreted proteins are down-regulated (Fig. 4B), similarly to data reported by Vojtov et. al. (18), who demonstrated that two staphylococcal superantigens, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and enterotoxin B (SEB), strongly repressed production of secreted proteins. It is possible that these toxins act similarly to PVL, interacting with unknown factors that interfere with regulatory networks. Several genes encoding putative and known microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) (including SdrD) are up-regulated in the PVL-positive strains (Fig. 4A). The up-regulation of MSCRAMMs may lead to enhanced tissue adherence and colonization of PVL-expressing strains, thereby contributing to the virulence potential of these strains (19, 20). Spa is highly expressed in PVL-positive strains. Our in vivo data underscore the documented role of Spa as a proinflammatory factor in pneumonia (11). Increased production of Spa, coupled with the ability of PVL to lyse PMNs and macrophages (6), could lead to a vicious cycle of cell recruitment, lysis, and release of inflammatory mediators (7), resulting in overwhelming tissue inflammation and necrosis. Here, we show not only that PVL is a key virulence factor in pulmonary infections but also that expression of the luk-PV genes interferes with global regulatory networks, which may also enhance virulence. A detailed analysis of such dysregulation will be useful to identify targets for the potential development of novel therapies to treat S. aureus infections.
